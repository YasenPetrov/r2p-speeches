(spoke in Spanish):
My delegation takes note of the most recent report of
the Secretary-General on the responsibility to protect
(A/73/898). Cuba reiterates that the issue it addresses
remains a source of grave concern for many countries,
in particular small and developing States, owing to the
lack of consensus on and clear definitions of various
elements of this concept, which has been and could
continue to be easily manipulated for political endsIt would be a mistake to talk about the principle
of the responsibility to protect. This responsibility,
rather, is a concept that is not by any means a principle
of international law. Its characteristics, the rules for its
implementation and the mechanisms for its assessment
are far from having been defined and agreed upon.

In that respect, it would be inappropriate to speak
of the strengthening of the implementation of the
responsibility to protect in the absence of consensus
on its scope, purposes and implications that would
lead to agreement on issues relating to differences
in its interpretation, ensure its universal recognition
and acceptance, and lend legitimacy to the measures
proposed for its implementationThe
international
understanding
on
the
responsibility to protect is limited simply to paragraphs
138 and 139 of resolution 60/1, only for cases of
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity. The duty of the international
community lies, as appropriate, in encouraging and
assisting States to exercise that responsibility.

The term “atrocity crimes” does not form part of
this understanding, and therefore it should not be used
in connection with the four premises mentioned in
paragraphs 138 and 139, in addition to being legally
inappropriate and totally ambiguous in terms of giving
substance to such a controversial conceptCuba is deeply concerned by terms such as
“atrocity crimes” and “mass atrocities”, which are very
ambiguous and can be used in selective ways and for
political ends to refer to various situations, given the
lack of clarity and agreement regarding the United
Nations mechanisms and bodies that are would be
charged with defining and interpreting the concept.

In the unipolar world that some are attempting to
impose on us and in which political and media-related
manipulation is being carried out by major axes of
power, it is vital to clearly define who decides when
protection is necessary; who decides when a State is
not protecting its people; who, and based on which
criteria, decides what action to take; and how we can
prevent this issue from being used for the purposes
of intervention. Nor is it clear how to ensure that the
option of taking action is exercised with the agreement
of the State affected, so as to avoid the concept being
used as a justification for a supposed and non-existent
right to intervene.

The international efforts under way to prevent
the occurrence of acts of genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity, goals that Cuba
has always shared and supported, must contribute
to strengthening the purposes and principles of the
Charter of the United Nations and international law,
in particular when it comes to sovereign equality,
territorial integrity and self-determinationNonetheless, the ambiguous nature of this concept
and the implications of the implementation of its
so-called three pillars run counter to the purpose
and principles of the Charter. Therefore, we need
to recognize the pre-eminence of the principles of
voluntary action, prior consent and the consent of all
States in the context of the responsibility to protectFinally, Cuba firmly supports any endeavour that
would ensure that the international community does
not turn a blind eye to genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing or crimes against humanity. However, in
many cases promoting the responsibility to protect is an
excuse to have yet another tool to facilitate interference
in domestic affairs, regime-change agendas and
subversion in third countries, the majority of which
are small and developing countries, to the detriment of
their sovereignty. Unfortunately, world history already
has a wealth of sad examples that justify our concerns..

If the goal is prevention, what we should do is
address the root causes of such situations, including
underdevelopment and poverty, the inequitable
international order, inequality and social exclusion,
hunger and marginalization, food insecurity and the
lack of access to drinking water, and the structural
problems that allow conflicts to escalate into extreme
situations, inter alia, which, regrettably, are not taken
into account by many advocates of this concept. We
believe that dealing with these issues would represent
genuine acts of prevention
