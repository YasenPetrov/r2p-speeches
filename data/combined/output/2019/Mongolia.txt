A cross-regional group
of States initiated resolution 73/304, which was just
adopted. That is the result of two years of collective
work as part of the Global Alliance for Torture-free
Trade, which brings together over 60 countries from
around the world.

The number of countries committed to abolishing
the death penalty and eliminating torture and inhuman
and degrading treatment has increased significantly
over the past two decades. However, serious challenges
remain. Goods used for torture are still produced and
sold and eventually find their way to buyers around
the world.

The entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development is centred on respect for human rights
and human dignity. We, the Member States, have the
primary responsibility for upholding human rights.

To that end, the members of the Global Alliance for
Torture-free Trade presented the resolution, which calls
on the United Nations to examine the feasibility, scope
and parameters for possible common international
standards for torture-free trade, bearing in mind the
international consensus that torture is a violation of
human rights and international treaties.

We are of the view that no one should be subjected
to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment. Therefore, as an initiator and
a member of the Global Alliance for Torture-free Trade,
we supported this important initiative.
