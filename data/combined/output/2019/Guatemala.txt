(spoke in Spanish): We
welcome the convening of this plenary meeting so that
we can address an issue to which Guatemala attaches
great importance, that is, the responsibility to protectThis meeting is taking place against a controversial
international backdrop, which makes it necessary to
return to the standard of international security and
human rights conceived at the 2005 World Summit,
with the aim of preventing the most atrocious war
crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanityWe take note of the report (A/73/898) of the
Secretary-General entitled “The responsibility to
protect: lessons learned for prevention”. We would
also like to make several additional remarks in
that connection.

The General Assembly has recognized that every
State, as a society organized on the basis of laws, bears
the primary responsibility for protecting its population
and preventing atrocities such as those we have seen
in the past. That underscores the genesis and the
relevance of the responsibility to protect in terms of its
implementation today. It is a principle that is rooted in
the fundamental purpose of the Charter of the United
Nations, which is to prevent the scourge of war and to
promote peace among peoples and nationsWe would like to express our appreciation of the
fact that the responsibility to protect is on this session’s
General Assembly agenda. That demonstrates the
membership’s broad interest in the issue being discussed
in this forum. We therefore believe that the inclusion
of this item on the agenda of the General Assembly
shows the appropriateness of the forum to discuss
its implementation as an exemplary mechanism for
protecting populations from barbarity and guaranteeing
them the enjoyment of their human rights.

From our national perspective, the responsibility
to protect is a norm that corresponds with our
constitutional principles, since the State of Guatemala
was established to protect individuals and families and
its ultimate goal is achieving the common goodSeventy-one years after the adoption of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the responsibility to
protect must be recognized as the exemplary way
to protect populations from mass atrocities. It must
therefore be strengthened, particularly given the new
hotbeds of tension in which similar trends prevail, in
the worst cases leading to new crimes against humanity
and cases of ethnic cleansing. My delegation is proud
to be part of the code of conduct initiative to prevent
the use of the veto in the Security Council in cases of
genocide and crimes against humanity, and we urge
other States to join it.

We therefore reiterate our call to uphold international
obligations under international human rights law,
international law and refugee law, since protecting
the civilian population is intrinsically linked to themIn that context, in order to support the protection of
civilians, Guatemala is honoured to be a country that
contributes to United Nations peacekeepingGuatemala recognizes that the principle of the
responsibility to protect is complemented by the
concept of sustainable peace, since it prioritizes
respect for and observance of human rights, based on
a preventive approach in order to avoid confrontationsWe welcome the concerted efforts of the Office on
Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect
and its vital work in such a significant area. In that vein,
my delegation highlights the individual and collective
capacities to prevent mass atrocities, which are
enhanced by the Global Network of the Responsibility
to Protect Focal PointsIn conclusion, as a promoter of the responsibility
to protect, Guatemala reaffirms its commitment to the
principle and urges that we step up our efforts towards
its full implementation.
