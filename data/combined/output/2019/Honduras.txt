(spoke in Spanish): At the
outset, I would like to express my country’s satisfaction
at the holding, once again, of a formal debate on
the responsibility to protect and the prevention of
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity — a unique opportunity for the States
Members of the United Nations to promote dialogue on
actions to implement the responsibility to protect, in
line with the 2005 World Summit outcome documentMy country welcomes the report of SecretaryGeneral António Guterres entitled “Responsibility to
protect: lessons learned for prevention” (A/73/898). It
reflects the need to identify lessons learned and positive
examples of prevention in order to make progress in the
implementation of its strategy on the responsibility to
protect, which rests on its three pillars.

Honduras believes that it is necessary to strengthen
international cooperation in order to respond to the
great challenges currently facing developing countries,
giving priority to respect for international human
rights, international humanitarian law and the rights of
refugees and migrants. Similarly, the responsibility to
protect must go hand in hand with efforts to achieve
genuine sustainable peace, which is intended to
contribute to the strengthening of international peace
and security by ensuring the full participation of women
and young people in all spheres of society, particularly
in prevention and peacebuildingFor my country, the responsibility to protect is a
priority and, although much remains to be done, in
recent years joint actions have been carried out by the
public sector, including the National Congress, the
Ministries of Human Rights, Security and Defence,
academia and civil society. The State of Honduras
has made significant progress in this area, with the
adoption in 2017 of a new criminal code that, pursuant
to approved norms, defines the penalties for the
crimes of genocide, war crimes and crimes against
humanity, and establishes in detail the type of penalty
applicable to each of these types of crimes against the
international community.

I would also like to stress that Honduras is a member
of and an active participant in the Latin American
Network for Genocide and Mass Atrocity Prevention, an
initiative focused on the development of public policies
at the regional level in the area of human rights and
the fight against discrimination, with a special focus
on the prevention of atrocities. My country has also
incorporated the issue of genocide and the prevention
of mass atrocities into the training curriculum for
public servants and members of the armed forces of
Honduras. In addition, we have published educational
material focused on the prevention of discriminationIn conclusion, my country is committed to the
Rome Statute and — together with the relevant
bodies at the national, regional and international
levels — to continuing to make progress in the system
for the prevention of these atrocity crimes and the
responsibility to protect the population of Honduras..

Furthermore, the public servants of the Ministry of
Human Rights and other governmental institutions
have benefited from training in the subject by the
Auschwitz Institute for Peace and Reconciliation, for
which we are grateful
