Mr. President,
Switzerland congratulates Adama Dieng and Jennifer Welsh, Special Advisers on the Prevention of
Genocide and on the Responsibility to Protect for the very useful and timely report which focuses on
the second pillar of the Responsibility to ProtectRecent situations, such as South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Syria or Iraq, are tragic examples recalling that the international Community is far away from having succeeded in implementing the
norms and standards that the International Community has developed so far. This reminds us that we
need to work further and develop better synergies among all existing mechanisms and initiatives to
prevent mass atrocities. Early understanding, Early deciding, Early acting are key for prevention to be
effective. This is valid for each pillar.

Switzerland has been partnering with several states since 2008, with the view to strengthen national
and regional political engagement for the prevention of atrocities. After the realization of four regional
fora on the prevention of genocide, participating states came to the conclusion that national and regional efforts are indeed taking place and some success can be celebrated. Nevertheless, these efforts shall be reinforced where they take place and regional peer to peer support could be strengthened. The launch, in 2013, of the Global Action Against Mass Atrocity Crimes, GAAMAC, a state-led
initiative to prevent mass atrocity crimes (war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and ethnic
cleansing) is an important step in this direction; GAAMAC focuses on prevention at the national and
regional level and supports states engaged in preventing mass atrocity crimes who are considering
developing preventive strategies. GAAMAC serves as a platform for exchange and dissemination of
learning and good practices. This is an excellent example of Pillar I and II initiatives.

For this to happen, the report of the Special Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide and on the Responsibility to Protect is insisting on several crucial elements: national ownership, mutual commitment,
Do no harm, prevention as a priority and flexible approaches. It further underlines crucial components
of the prevention architecture, such as
-
Promoting and protecting the rights of cultural, ethnic, national, linguistic and religious minorities
A professional and accountable security sector
Impartial institutions for overseeing political transitions and enhancing civic trust
Independent judicial and human rights institutions
Capacity to assess risk and mobilize early response
Local capacity to resolve conflicts
Media capacity to counteract prejudice and hate speech
Capacity for effective and legitimate transitional justice
It is crucial to support the emergence of national policies and architectures of prevention. As this report states, “If properly conceived and consistently executed, international assistance as part of Pillar
II can reinforce the efforts that States are already making to protect their populations from atrocity
crimes”.

In this regard, a series of important mechanism and initiatives are quoted in this report, such as National Human Rights Institutions, Human Rights Council and its mechanism such as the UPR, the
“Rights up Front” initiative, international and regional networks for the prevention of atrocities and early
warning systems. These mechanisms are useful tools. Switzerland calls for these efforts to be developed in a spirit of mutual reinforcement and to contribute to a constructive complementarity among all
these initiatives and actors involved.

In 2015, we will celebrate the 10 year anniversary of the 2005 World Summit Outcome; Switzerland
would welcome the Office of the Special Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide and on the Responsibility to Protect to realize a report illustrating the efforts developed by states at the national and regional levels. This report could develop some best practices and lessons to be learned regarding national architectures and policies and analyze the different components of such architectures notably
the promotion and protection of rule of law and human rightsSuch a report would be a very valuable and constructive contribution, a vibrant testimony regarding
existing efforts realized by states, involved and willing to take their responsibility seriously, alone and
with the support of the International Community. This could definitively represent an important milestone in this long term endeavorMission permanente de la Suisse auprès des Nations Unies
