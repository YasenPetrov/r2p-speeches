MINISTER/R2P
PERMANENT MISSION OF NIGERIA TO THE UNITED NATIONS
AT THE
INFORMAL INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE ON THE
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT: MOBILIZING COLLECTIVE
ACTION: THE NEXT DECADE FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY TO
PROTECT
NEW YORK, 6TH SEPTEMBER 2016
Mr. Moderator,
The Nigerian delegation aligns with the statement of the Group of Friends
and welcomes the Secretary-General's 8th Report on the Responsibility to
Protect themed; Mobilizing collective action: The next decade for
the Responsibility to Protect. The Report which is a follow up to the
2015 report provides a vision for collective action to implement R2P amid
an impending leadership change at the UN.

Mr. Moderator,
R2P is based on international humanitarian and human rights law and
represents a global conceptual and policy shift in the notion of sovereignty
and security. Suffice to say that R2P was endorsed by member states
during the World Summit in 2005 to prevent and respond to Genocide, War
crimes, Ethnic cleansing and Crimes against humanity; recent experiences
in Cote d'Ivoire, Libya, Ukraine and Syria conveyed clear lessons that the
cooperation of, and among, member states is critically essential to the
successful operationalisation of the Responsibility to Protect. Today's
dialogue therefore is timely for member states to rededicate their efforts
towards the actualisation and implementation of the vision as conceived in
2005.

Africa initiated the principle of R2P through article 4(H) of the African
Union Constitutive Act. It's implementation in the region was established
with the signature of the ECOWAS Protocol on Mutual Defense Assistance
signed on 29th May 1981, in Sierra Leone and the interventions led by
Nigeria through the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in Liberia in
1990, which helped stop the carnage in those countries. Nigeria used this
instrument to support peaceful resolution of conflicts in various countries in
Africa, especially in the West African sub-regionMr. Moderator,
As highlighted in the Regional Forum on the Responsibility to Protect which
was held in Nigeria in June 2012, it is necessary to intensify efforts towards
clarifying the concept of R2P as a result of the perceived reluctance of
member states to subscribe to the principle's operationalisation, which is
enshrouded in scepticism. The efforts of the Global Centre for the
Responsibility to Protect as the Secretariat of the Global Network
of Focal Points, in championing the cause of the principle through
the recommendation of strategies to encourage political will and
cooperation among Member states, is highly commendable. It is
important for Member states to support those efforts by
subscribing to R2P. Nigeria recently became the 53rd Focal Point of R2PNigeria remains determined to work in concert with other stakeholders in
ensuring a more effective operationalisation of the R2P.

This is an expression of the support of my country to the principle. It is of
necessity for more member states to appoint Focal Points so as to
facilitate and accelerate the full understanding and acceptance of
the principleMr. Moderator,
Nigeria suggested during the 2015 Focal Points meeting in Madrid, that
Member states should consider the appointment of regional Focal PointsNigeria believes that in the next decade of the R2P, such a strategy will
facilitate and fast-track the understanding and acceptance of the principle
