Statement delivered by Nicaragua – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2016 
[TRANSLATION] 
Mr. Chair, 
We thank you for having convened this meeting on the subject of the Responsibility to Protect, 
a theme on which much remains to be saidOur delegation in concerned by the fact that report A/70/999 is calling for the implementation 
of R2P when there is no consensus on this theme in the General Assembly and when the views 
of many countries have yet to be heard on this subjectSir, 
The UN Charter does not include any kind of reference to a right of interference or 
humanitarian intervention, however it does include references to the principle of protection of 
the sovereignty and non-­‐interference in the internal affairs of states. Under no circumstance 
can it be asserted, as is done in this report, that R2P is a principle of international law.

Sir, 
Since 2003, we have seen invasions of stable states in the name of R2P, which have sown chaos, 
death and destruction. Since the fatidic date of 2003, we have witnessed how interventionism 
and violations of sovereignty have led to the complete disintegration of states and caused 
suffering to populations. The situation of some regions of our planet are such that we see flows 
of millions of refugees and in some cases the establishment of the Islamic StateSir, we also reiterate that at no point in time has there been a real dialogue on the theme of 
R2P, and disagree to adopting it as a factIn the inspiring words of our President Daniel Ortega Saavedra: “Our Organization must 
respond to the challenges of our time with measures and actions reflecting the supreme 
interest of the people: the respect, inviolability of sovereignty, the acknowledgement of natural 
resources and patrimony, the promotion of security, justice and peace.

Sir, 
Nicaragua advocate for the reformation of the United Nations, so that everyone’s interests may 
prevail, so that we can speak and listen to one another as equals, all of us Members States, 
avoiding any form of meddling, interference or intervention, in the affairs of sovereign states
