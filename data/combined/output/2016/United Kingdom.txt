Statement by Ambassador Matthew Rycroft, UK
Permanent Representative to the United Nations, on the
Responsibility to ProtectThank you very much Mr. President, and thank you to the SecretaryGeneral for his report on the Responsibility to Protect. It’s very strong
focus on the challenges of implementing that doctrine are especially
welcome, and I would like to reaffirm at the outset the United Kingdom’s
commitment to implementing the R2P doctrine, and I would like to thank
all of the panellists for everything that they do, and continue to do, on
such an important global issueResponsibility to Protect is a global issue that can be seen on virtually
every item that comes to the Security Council’s agenda. It can also be
seen on the faces of the thousands being forced to flee from Juba in
July, or the hundreds of thousands of poor civilians in Syria who are
besieged or under attack in Aleppo. So we must redouble our efforts on
R2P for their sakes.

I think there are three areas that deserve special attentionFirst, there has been, as others have said, a stark increase in atrocities
over recent years. Early warning must be met with early action. The
Security Council has failed too many times in this regard. The findings of
the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism in Syria show just how
horrific the consequences can be when we fail to prevent such conflict,
in that instance with the use of chemical weapons against civilians of
Syria by the Asad regimeSecond, international humanitarian law, international human rights law,
and international refugee law are the foundation on which the R2P
doctrine is built. And Member States, every single one of us, must meet
those obligations so that civilians living in conflict today have a chance to
live in a peace that they deserve tomorrow. And I hope that this call to
action can be echoed by everyone in this room. And crucially, that action
can then follow words.

In the face of ongoing atrocities, the Security Council must be able to
act. Nearly 6 in every 10 countries around the world have signed the
ACT Code of Conduct, calling for restraint of the veto for cases of mass
atrocities, and I’m proud that the UK is one of themMy final point is about one of the greatest terrorist threats of our timeFrom Mosul to Munich, Orlando to Aleppo, Paris to the mountainside of
Sinjar. Da’esh and those who share their hateful ideology have
demonstrated, in the most callous ways that they pose a significant
threat to innocent civiliansHolding these heinous individuals to account will send a strong signal to
those who seek to harm civilians. It’s part of our commitment, not only to
the doctrine of the Responsibility to Protect but also, and more
importantly, to the survivors and the victims and those who have lost
loved ones to Da’esh’s brutality.

Part of our Responsibility to Protect lies in ensuring that those who seek
to harm civilians know that impunity is not an option. In July, British
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson announced plans for a UK-led
campaign to hold Da’esh to account. I am pleased to say it today we will
officially launch that campaign during the high level week of UNGA (UN
General Assembly) this year
