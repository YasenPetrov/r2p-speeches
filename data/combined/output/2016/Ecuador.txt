Statement delivered by Ecuador – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2016 
[TRANSLATION] 
Thank you Mr. ChairIt is a pleasure to see you preside this session of the General Assembly. My delegation believes in the 
usefulness of organizing interactive dialogues to discuss specific themes of critical importance for the 
international community, insofar as the participants to this dialogue will pay due attention to our 
interlocutors and choose to change the status quo. Because if we continue to do things the same way, 
we will keep getting the same results or worseFurthermore, Sir, the issue for which we are gathered here today is the principle of responsibility to 
protect from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, which should be 
exercised within the framework and in line with the objectives and principles of the Charter, and within 
the limits of international law, in order to effectively translate the principle into actions with the 
appropriate R2P.

Ecuador recognizes that the Responsibility to Protect population is intrinsic to the notion of sovereignty 
of States, but we reject the preventive use of force as part of the concept of R2PIt is a fact, as the Secretary-­‐General has said in his report that, I quote: “Despite this progress, the 
international community has fallen woefully short of its aspiration to prevent and respond to atrocity 
crimes […] brutal and intractable conflicts are devastating the lives of millions of people in almost every 
region, threatening the future of entire generations”Hence my delegation believes that in order to have a preventive, opportune, appropriate and 
categorical action to face atrocity crimes, a necessary condition is to democratize the international 
system, which will give rise to a fairer, more equitable, viable and legitimate international order, and 
moreover not to “securitize” R2P.

Mr. Chair and Delegates, 
The democratic deficit in international organizations which make up the current international system 
resulting from the post-­‐war era in general, and the United Nations and the Security Council in particular, 
must be urgently corrected if we want our Organization to respond in an appropriate way to the 
objectives and principles which led to its creationIt is particularly concerning that when the Security Council does not act because of differences between 
their members in the face of atrocities occurring in various location on the planet, the General Assembly 
cannot act either and cannot make any recommendations – in accordance with Article 12 of the Charter 
– because the matter stands before the Security Council.

Sir, it is important to avoid that UN issues be “securitized” under the pretext of peace and security or 
R2P. With aggravating circumstances following the “securitization” and falling within the Council’s 
jurisdiction, crises of a humanitarian character worsen and nothing can be done due to the paralysis 
resulting from the differences and interests of its members. Finally, it gave way to military interventions 
– which can be legally acceptable according to Chapter VII, but have been harmful in many occasions – 
irrespective non only of the option of working with other UN bodies, but also of the option of working in 
a coordinated manner with regional organizations in conformity with Chapter VIII of the Charter and 
with Chapter VI with regards to the peaceful settlement of disputesWe as Member States are responsible for providing the United Nations with the type of leadership that 
is needs and deserves in order to work effectively to make this world a better place, an particularly for 
future generations
