Statement delivered by Sudan – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2016
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]
Thank you, chair. In a dangerous world where there are so many differences between different
countries, sovereignty is the main line of defense. But the line of defense is not only important in
this context. It also means equality among all peoples in terms of dignity and protection of
people’s identity and their possibilities to determine their future. The principle of sovereignty,
especially equal sovereignty, is enshrined in Article 2.1 of the Charter. Which means that within
a state, the state can adopt measures regarding its sovereignty but it doesn’t mean absolute
authority. It is governed by laws upon the authority. When we are speaking of sovereignty as a
responsibility, this does not mean that any administration can interfere so long as a state exists
and can implement its own responsibilities vis-a-vis citizenry.

Because of certain forbidden actions such as interference as stated in the Charter, except for
humanitarian exceptions, the Security Council has interpreted Chapter 7 to allow such
interventions. We are of the view that we must take into account the main reasons for such
conflict. An intervention being there means that we have to face up to the lack of capacity of a
given democracy to enhance confidence and dealing with economic deprivation and lack of
economic opportunityDuring the last three decades, we have witnessed a deterioration of the environment which has
led to internal conflict and threatens the very survival of our planet. Which means that aggression
is not only upon peace and security but humankind as a whole so we must take into account
providing opportunities for development and cooperation to deal with the lack of justice in the
distribution of resources and in order to increase opportunities which developing countries
should have to be in the external markets and to engage in important changes in their structures
and organizations. This also requires a rethinking of the juridical protection and assisting
countries to implement sovereign laws and the possibility to protect their institutions. If we want
to enhance states’ sovereignty rather than the opposite, the international community should
intervene when we are dealing with action which involves attacks upon human rights and it’s
important to act in a balanced way between these two issuesFinally, Mr. President, as the UK Foreign Office has stated in or around 1983, while commenting
on this nascent concept of R2P, that dubious agenda do always take the disguise of lofty
principles. We are of a strong conviction that this argument is valid to date. Thank you
