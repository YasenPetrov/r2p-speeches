Informal Interactive Dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect
the United Nations General Assembly:
Statement by Mr. Adama Dieng
Special Adviser to the Secretary-General for the Prevention of Genocide
New York, September 6, 2016
Mister President,
Mr. Deputy Secretary-General,
Excellencies and delegates,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Introduction
If, in the early twenty-first century, no country can impose its lasting dictatorship by
weapons on its civilian population, it is also clear that no country, whatever its
power, can not, by itself, come to the aid of those in distress, within
lead a liberation war by proxy. Those days seem gone. But it |
however, that is still the death toll in suffering, in misery for
civilians remains unbearable.

Rest multilateral diplomacy United NationsShe has the right instrument to achieve this?
Yes, but it is not yet finished and shared: This is the "Responsibility to Protect"
(R2P) "peaceful weapon," including the United Nations equip themselves, 60 years after their creation,
when the nature of armed conflict has changed from inter-state confrontations
internal riftsMy contribution to the debate today is simple, which is to remind your
Remember some of the main points of the 2016 report on the responsibility of
protect the particular aim of food for thought in no doubt rich, who
will follow in the informal interactive dialogue.

As you know, this year's report is based on the findings of the report
Previous and aims to assess progress on the principle of responsibility
protect, ten years after its adoption at the 2005 World SummitThis year, the Secretary-General invites us to an even deeper reflection on
various obstacles to greater mobilization of collective action to
prevent and respond to genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. Our duty today is therefore in the context of
find effective ways to overcome these obstacles. :
A more difficult situation
The report establishes a link between the increase in the frequency and magnitude of
criminal atrocities and decreased respect for international humanitarian law. A
parallel is established between the increase in criminal atrocities and other
Key issues on the international agenda including the global crisis
forced displacement.

In the current difficult environment, it is more important than ever to protect
populations. The report calls for unity, not only to situations where
Quick and decisive action is required, but also - and especially - from the premises of a
crisisIn the opinion of the Secretary General, political divisions prevent decisive action. By
Therefore, the search for unity is an essential part of the implementation of
the responsibility to protectIt is our duty to reflect and realize our political commitments
There is no doubt that other factors influence the implementation of the
responsibility to protect, which also were raised during the seven dialogues
interactive prior to the General Assembly on the Responsibility to Protect.

First, some Member States still question the relationship between the three
pillars, wondering if they should run sequentially under
the implementation of the responsibility to protect. The report emphasizes that the pillars
are not designed to run sequentially, but specifies that the use
some preventive tools or reagents must follow a sequential logic. By
Therefore, the use of military force should be the ultima ratioSecond, Member States requested clarification regarding
Basic components for industrial action in response to
situations where States obviously can not protect their populations
against criminal atrocities. The report puts forward several proposals
focus on strengthening early warning mechanisms to ensure that
credible information provided by impartial actors, can reach the appropriate decision-making bodies within the United Nations and
elsewhere.

It is clear that the conceptual issues should not hinder the development
implement the responsibility to protect, given the number of situations in the world
where people at high risk of crimes and atrocities. We have
not that luxury. We must continue to take collective action to meet
political commitment adopted by Member States in 2005, where and when it will be
necessaryHowever, we must not ignore the conceptual issues. The dialogues
periodicals, such as the one we are having today, so help reduce
considerable differences and to put on the table the challenges and opportunities
surrounding the implementation of the principle of protection. I think it would be desirable to
find other opportunities to discuss these dialogues, either formally or
informal.

Barriers to implementation
The report refers to three types of developments that threaten to widen
the gap between the commitments of Member States and the reality that people
vulnerable face. First, we are witnessing an alarming disregard for principles
fundamentals of international law. Second, Member States have not
sufficiently translated their commitments regarding crime prevention
atrocity since concrete prevention strategies do not exist in some
frames. Third, we note with concern the increasing role of stakeholders
External that amplify the commission of criminal atrocitiesA vision for collective action
To enforce the political commitment of States to take action
collective, the Secretary-General encourages the implementation of existing measures
four fronts.

First, it is necessary to continue to develop and coordinate strategies
prevention to make them more effective. Although it has been said many
times, we still need to improve efforts to collect and
analyze relevant information. Much effort has been devoted to
improving technical elements relating to the collection of information. Nevertheless, we must strengthen our capacity to share sensitive information that could
lead to an effective preventive actionFurthermore, effective prevention may require changing some practices
job. We must adopt adequate measures to ensure that the discussions
on specific situations of concern focus more on
identifying strategic options to address risks. It could
encourage rapid action to protect populations.

The development of effective prevention strategies also requires the identification of
areas of complementarity with other key programs of action, including
prevention of violent extremism. When we look at the conditions for the
spread of violent extremism, we examine several of the risk factors
criminal atrocitiesSecond, we simply need to be prepared to provide a response
Quick and decisive. Each member of the international community that
responsibility, which can lead to different answers at different levels, it
either bilaterally or through the framework of regional organizations
International. This goes along with the need to increase investment in
wide range of peaceful tools at our disposal. On this front, it is necessary
increase coordination with regional actors and civil society
promote an appropriate response.

At the Security Council, the report calls for Council members to
leadership by accepting a certain restraint in the use of the veto
in situations involving heinous crimesThird, we all know about the close link between prevention and recurrenceAs the Deputy Secretary-General reminded us, too many countries that are
now face a risk of widespread and systematic violence, lived
before. The report encourages the provision of targeted support to national authorities
being in such recurrence of situations, including through
investments in transitional justice initiatives. I have in mind the process
reconciliationFinally, the Secretary-General encourages renew the institutional capacity to
overcome all these obstacles. At the UN, we are committed to intensify
our efforts to integrate the responsibility to protect in any situation that requires its
consideration. We are also committed to persevere in our efforts to revitalize and processing to make the organization fit to meet the challenges of
protection. At the national and regional levels, the report recognizes the importance of
global and regional networks and the national capacity building dedicated form
focal points for the responsibility to protectWe must also redouble our efforts to overcome political divisions. It is
vital to invest in strengthening practical capacity for prevention and response
fast. Finally, we must follow the call of the Secretary-General for strengthening the
political leadership to make the responsibility to protect a living reality. I
sincerely believe that all the points mentioned in this address are dependent
the latter element.

The report contains a suggestive list of steps to strengthen the capacity of
regional organizations to work with the United Nations and with other actors on
means prevention and response to criminal atrocitiesConclusion
The report concludes with a call to every member of the international community to
renew its commitment to the tool of responsibility to protect. This requires that we
d√©noricions genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity when committed or about to be committed, this requires
also that we give priority to the protection of vulnerable populations au
beyond narrow political interests, even legitimate
