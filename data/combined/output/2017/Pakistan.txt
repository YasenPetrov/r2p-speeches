Statement by Mr. Saad Ahmad Warraich, Counsellor, Pakistan Mission to the
UN, at the informal interactive dialogue on Responsibility to Protect (September
06, 2017)
Moderator,
We thank the President of the General Assembly for organizing this informal interactive
dialogue on the report of the Secretary General entitled ‘Implementing the Responsibility to
Protect: Accountability for prevention’My delegation welcomes the Secretary General’s renewed emphasis on prevention in his
report. Preventive diplomacy is indeed, one of the most underutilized tools in the armory of
the United NationsStrengthening accountability mechanisms can help enhance prevention outcomes. Asthe
Secretary General's report correctly notes, this goal could however, only be accomplished
within the framework of ‘agreed principles’.

Paragraphs 138 and 139 of the World Summit Outcome Document of 2005providethe
cornerstone of our collective commitment to prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing,
and crimes against humanityThis ‘responsibility to protect’ does not entail a new legal norm; it is merely a political
expression of what is already obligated on states, as their sovereign responsibility towards
their citizens. The primacy of individual state to protect its own population is a sine quo
nonwhich affords no derogationThis mandate also does not allow itself accretion. It is therefore, essential that we must
preserve the existing consensus over R2P. Any re-interpretation of this understanding, or
initiatives that lack broad support, should be avoided.

Moderator,
The edifice of the R2P stands on more tenuous ground today, than ever before. It is trulya sad reflection thatdecisions taken by the international community, have often
betrayed the highest standards of objectivity and impartiality; and punitive actions,
haveoften become thepreferred mode of choice, and not a measure of last resortThis masquerade of political expediency as high-flowing idealism has meant that resultant
actions have lacked the legal and moral legitimacy to gain wider acceptabilityAgainst this backdrop, calls for accountability would invariablysmack of double standards
and selectivity,especiallywhen egregious crimes including killings and mass blindings are
being committed in full view of the international community. Many of these unfortunate
victims have the further indignity of living under illegal and foreign occupation.

What is therefore, needed, is not a dereliction from our collective responsibility to prevent
these grave crimes, but to apply consistent and uniform standards of moral outrage to themThe ‘will’ of the international community, in particular, the permanent members of the
Security Council, is crucialModerator,
For the process of accountability to be meaningful, it should be credible; a means to
constructively engage delinquency, and not a platform to castigate states over alleged acts of
omission or commission. As we have witnessed in several instances, the special mandates
on country-situations testify to the limits of a divisive approach.We should avoid similar
‘politicization’ of the UPR mechanismThis often requires a complex and painstaking process of political compromise, which is often exacerbated, not aided, by military solutions. What is therefore, needed is an upsurge
in diplomacy, not war, to achievethe goal of prevention.

Priority should instead, be placed to assist states in creating strong national capacities
including through governance and judicial reforms, to effectively address challenges within
their jurisdictionsLong-term commitment of the international community including mobilization of adequate
resources in sustainable development and poverty eradication is the best investment in
preventionOn top, we must also address the root causes underlying internecine violence and conflict.
