Mr President,
Switzerland welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the role of regional and subregional
arrangements in implementing the responsibility to protect. The aim of this joint report drafted by the
special advisors on the prevention of genocide and on the responsibility to protect, is to consolidate a
common approach and to enable the formulation of more systematic and timely prevention strategiesThe report stresses to what extend the creation of regional and sub-regional mechanisms is crucial in
supporting prevention efforts undertaken by the States, as well as in adapting and implementing multi-
lateral strategies. Switzerland shares this view, and we would like to highlight three points.

1) Legitimacy is a decisive factor for preventive action. It is strengthened further when such action is in
line with the prevailing social and cultural contexts of the affected regions2) Regional implementation of the responsibility to protect has the additional advantage of providing
direct access to information, facilitating therefore a swift deployment of proximity responses. It also
enhances the early use of a multitude of civilian instruments, including facilitation, mediation, good
offices and political dialogue3) Finally, the report shows that the responsibility to protect is first and foremost a matter of responsi-
ble sovereignty. In the context of fragile states and countries affected by conflict, however, security,
the rule of law, good governance and socio-economic development must be strengthened in order to
forestall a return to a pernicious cycle of violence. It likewise falls to international stakeholders to act
responsibly by improving the coordination and effectiveness of their efforts, in a spirit of partnership
and mutual respect with national and regional stakeholders.

Mr. President,
Switzerland firmly believes in the importance of the regional approach, a position that is reflected in its
commitment of many years, in cooperation with Argentina and Tanzania, to organizing regional forums
on the prevention of genocide and other atrocities. The three regional forums that have already taken
place - in Buenos Aires, Arusha and Berne, respectively — provided an opportunity to address these
issues with the governments of the regions concernedThese fora have highlighted the variety of best practices that currently exist in a wide range of con-
texts, the importance of intra-regional relations, and the ability of regional-entities to devise construc-
tive prevention strategies. An excellent example is the International Conference on the Great Lakes
Region (CIRGL), which is committed to developing prevention strategies that can subsequently be
incorporated into existing structures. This process holds great promise and, in particular, reminds us
that two of the key factors behind the success of preventive action are political will and local owner-
ship. These fora also showed that responsible sovereignty and the prevention of mass atrocities are
the result of permanent dialogue between numerous stakeholders.

Switzerland learned several lessons from these regional fora, which we would like to share with you«First, the fight against impunity goes hand in hand with prevention. If the preventive impact of
international justice is to be strengthened, a set of instruments must be developed that enable
impunity to be combated more systematically. Recently, the international community has for
example repeatedly used investigation committees and fact-finding commissions. It is impor-

terms, that their procedures are well designed and that the nature of any links they may have
to judicial bodies, such as the International Criminal Court, is clearly defined.

« Second, the respect and active promotion of human rights is the aspect of responsible sove-
reignty that has the best preventive effect. We believe that the inclusion of prevention-related
indicators in the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the Human Rights Council would improve
the detection of high-risk situations and would send a clear message of strong commitment to
prevention¢ Third, and finally, these regional meetings also identified the need to designate national focal
points for atrocity prevention within the global prevention architecture, which would help
strengthen links between the national, regional and international levels of intervention. It is al-
so important that these focal points are afforded sufficient legitimacy and are equipped with
the power to convene, coordinate and communicate. It is only by narrowing the gap between
early detection efforts and the decision-making process, that atrocities will be best prevented
which in turn will contribute to avoid the need of resorting to drastic measures, such as the use
of forceMission permanente de la Suisse auprés des Nations Unies

Mr. President,
Convinced of the usefulness of such an instrument, Switzerland plans to establish its own national
focal point. It will head up a task force that brings together the competent offices on matters of diplo-
macy, public international law and development cooperation. The combination of both mandates of
prevention and of fighting impunity is a message in itself, and we firmly believe that an effective fight
against impunity can contribute to prevent atrocities
