Mr. president,
The principle of the Responsibility to Protect gives states a framework to prevent any produce
of the four most serious crimes known to humanity: war crimes, crimes against humanity,
ethnic cleansing and genocide.

This time include the first two pillars of the responsibility to protect, on the one hand,
because it is the focus of today's debate and, secondly, because it is in those pillars which will take place the great
Most efforts to protect civilians.

education, and also through a system of promotion and strengthening of human rights, a
universal access to justice, among others.

As for the second pillar, that is international cooperation to prevent any of the four crimes
above may occur in a particular country, Chile understood that this can only be given with due
consent of the State concerned. Cooperative action is unthinkable without such consent.

obligation to impart justice.

effective early warning system that allows to point out to the State itself, in the right way, the danger of
in a short time you can fall into any of the crimes that tries to avoid the Responsibility to Protect
