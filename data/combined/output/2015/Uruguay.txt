1 Mr. President,
First, let me congratulate and thank the President of the Assembly
General for convening this important dialogue on a subject to which my country
assigns a high priorityI also wish to welcome the latest report of the Secretary-General
entitled "A vital and enduring commitment: to establish the liability of
protect ", in which a stock of progress made is made and
implementation efforts on the three pillars, as well as addressed the
challenges and threats today to the responsibility to protect.

Mr. President,
This is not a year since a decade is met since the adoption of the
Final Document of the 2005 Summit, the text of the concept was introduced
the responsibility to protect by paragraphs 138 and 139From that date until today progress has been registered, including 30
Resolutions of the Security Council and 13 resolutions of the Council
Human rights, including the responsibility to protectBut this year not only marks the 10th anniversary of the responsibility to protect it
also the 70th anniversary of the United Nations so we understand
adequate time for the General Assembly adopted a Resolution
matter to translate the consensus that day register and date
also to include the item on its formal agenda.

Mr. President,
Uruguay as a member of the ACT Group supports its proposed Code
Conduct with the aim that the permanent members of the Council
Security refrain from using the veto in the case of those resolutions
They are related to mass atrocities and also adheres to the
French initiative of voluntary abstention from the permanent members of the
Security Council in the case of genocide, war crimes, cleaning
ethnic and crimes against humanityUruguay, a country that unfortunately experienced the horrors of a dictatorship
military between 1973 and 1984 who committed crimes against humanity, assigned to the
accountability of fundamental importance in the case of crimes
atrocious and in that sense we emphasize the importance of the International Criminal Court
in the fight against impunity for crimes of genocide, war crimes
and crimes against humanity.

Mr President, we are aware that despite progress, the responsibility to protect
remains a concept discussed politically, particularly the link
which almost automatically becomes the "Pillar 3" and within this the
possibility of employing the use of forceHowever, we recognize that the pillars 1 and 2 are the most widely
accepted and have to do with preventing mass atrocities, are
the most effective ways to address the issue of the responsibility to protectThrough the designation of focal points at the time amounted to 49
They are strengthening preventive national and regional capacities and the
same time are also taken steps towards confidence-building
among States.

I especially want to emphasize the role of international organizations in the
prevention agenda, while noting that Operations
Peacekeeping is a prevention tool increasingly
relevant in the context of intra-state conflicts as they can help
prevent the resumption of conflict, avoiding or minimizing abuses of the State
receptor and / Rebel groups register developments and improvements in the area of
protection of civilians and may be an early warning toolIn 10 of the 16 operations Peacekeeping found
currently deployed there Protection of Civilians mandates that
developed within the framework of the International Humanitarian Law, Rights
Human and Refugees, and bearing in mind that the obligation
Primary protect civilians rests with the State HeadquartersMr. President,
Uruguay is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Council
Security in the 2016-17 biennium and if elected will continue to work from that place
and others with a view to the rights of all, particularly the most
vulnerable, they are respected.

My country has confirmed actions over the years his vocation and will
to protect civilians through its ongoing and active participation in
venues in which these issues are discussed as well as it does in the
field through its concrete contribution of troops who work daily
Noble committed to that task
