United Nations General Assembly
Please compare the words of the speaker
September 8, 2015 ud 7004 99:21 S102 / 4GB / L0 / A. Mr. President,
oneWe thank the President of the General Assembly for organizing this
Informal interactive dialogue and the Secretary General for his presentationVenezuela is committed to the need to prevent crimes
against humanity, war, genocide and ethnic cleansing, wherever they occur and
the comet who commitsThat does not mean that we agree that the responsibility to protect
is the appropriate means to meet this need.

The promoters of the responsibility to protect and officials of Nations
United have tended to focus, for tactical reasons, in areas of consensus
such as prevention, but the main international controversy revolves around the
military intervention and the use of force to protectThe responsibility to protect seeks to divide states into two categories:
responsible (good) and irresponsible (bad). The classification
They held a group of countries that are considered morally superior to
others. All those who fall into the field of irresponsible can
be subject to military interventionHowever, a quick glance look at the record of the promoters more
Burning of the responsibility to protect reveals a picture very consistent
morally.

During the 90s, Iraq was subject to the sanctions regime more extensive
the history of the United Nations. Iraq depended on exports
oil for its revenues and sanctions blocked all exportsIraq depended on imports for virtually all other
needs of society, and sanctions also blocked almost all
imports. The sanctions contained, however, a clause under
which Iraq could import food to avoid what had called it a
"Humanitarian situation". But differences over which constituted a "situation
Pag. 2 of 5 humanitarian "reveal the true intentions of their promoters. For
Cuba and Yemen, permanent non-elected members of the Security Council,
a "humanitarian situation" would exist as soon as signs were complied with
malnutrition in the Iraqi population. Delegates from the United States and the United
Britain, on the other hand, argued that it could only speak of a "situation
humanitarian "if widespread famine occurred Iraqi population.

Estimates of the human cost of sanctions imposed on Iraq between
1991 and 1998 are between 500,000 and 2 million peopleAfter defeating Saddam Hussein in 2003, the United States dismantled the army
He Iraq of more than 400 thousand troops, fired more than thirty-five thousand
civil service employees, including university professors, teachers
schools and media officials, and it prevented the creation of an interim governmentFollowed abdicated their responsibilities point as an Occupying Power under the
Geneva Convention and left the country before an empty cash togovernment buildings, universities, libraries, hospitals, and museums
They were looted. Insufficient troops to safeguard million
You tons of ammunition abandoned by the Iraqi army and to safeguard
borders with Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Iran, meant that provinces
Iraq entire stay at the mercy of armed bands and insurgencies.

10.The conservative estimates of the US invasion in 2003 put the
elevendeath toll in half a million people. The seed for the emergence
ISIS and strengthening of A the Qaeda and other terrorist groups in the region
He had been planted and paidOn 17 March 2011, the Security Council adopt Resolution 1973,
the responsibility to protect, authorizing a coalition of countries
take all necessary measures to protect the Libyan population. The
coalition would go far beyond massively arming and assisting forces
rebels, changing the regime, destroying the entire infrastructure
institutional development of the State, and laying the groundwork for a power vacuum that still
lurks to the Libyan people. Weapons of the conflict would soon reach the region
Pag. 3 de5 Sahel, exponentially enhanced military power Boko Haram, To the Qaeda and
At the Shabaab.

12.The sanctions and military interventions promoted by the porta
standards of international morality are responsible for the death of
million people and the emergence and consolidation of terrorist forces
most heinous and powerful ever seen. How many have been held accountable for the
deaths of millions of civilians? How many people have been brought to the
international justice for crimes committed? How many have assumed
responsibility for the conflicts in the Middle East and North
Africa today? How President Hugo Chavez said at the 2005 Summit,
Who will protect us from these so called protectors?
Mr. President,
13. How do we conclude that the war is a mechanism I right
to prevent war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and ethnic cleansing?
Some countries with large military-industrial appliances tend to see the war
and coercion as a natural choice, even as a necessity. Venezuela
has never been involved in a war since it reached its
independence in 1821. Therefore, for us, the notion that the
war and coercion is the solution has no basis. In Latin America and the
Caribbean have created a regional and subregional effective architecture
resolve our disputes. Latin America and the Caribbean is a "Zone
Peace, "a" Nuclear Weapons Free Zone "and one of the most peaceful regions
of World16.This exchange of four minutes per State is not a process
intergovernmental. In fact, the conversation among Member States
began and ceased in 2005. As in previous years, Venezuela calls
to open intergovernmental negotiations on the aims,
scope, terms of reference, accountability mechanisms, the
responsibilities and the actions we can engage to prevent
crimes against humanity, war, genocide and ethnic cleansing. The future of
civilian populations can not depend on a nebulous concept,
manipulable and selective, the world expect much more from us.

Mr. President,
14.La way the concept of the responsibility to protect has been
development has lacked self-criticism, transparency and openness15.La responsibility to protect has been abrogated virtually all
tools of the United Nations Charter: the measures outlined in
Pag. May 4 Chapters VI and VII, maintenance of peace,
peace-building, preventive diplomacy, but it has not developed
criteria, steps, terms of reference, thresholds, responsibilities,
accountability mechanisms that allow us to understand how and
When these tools are applied within the framework of the call
responsibility to protect
