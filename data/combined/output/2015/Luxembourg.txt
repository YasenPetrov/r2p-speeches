Secretary General's Report
"An essential and constant commitment: implementation of the responsibility to protect"
New York, September 8, 2015
Statement by HE Ms. Sylvie Lucas
Ambassador, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg
Mr. Moderator,
I thank President Sam Kutesa for convening this informal interactive dialogue of the Assembly
General. It gives me the opportunity to reaffirm the full support of Luxembourg to implement
the principle of responsibility to protect. Ten years after the 2005 World Summit, this principle
still relevantLuxembourg joins the speeches made by the EU and the Netherlands
on behalf of the Group of Friends of the responsibility to protect. At the national level, I will present three
comments.

First, the atrocities, war crimes and crimes against humanity that continue to be
committed in Syria, Iraq, Central African Republic or South Sudan should we
bring all to do more to implement the principle of responsibility
protect, efficiently and consistently. This requirement of the implementation is made more
urgently by new protection challenges posed by non-state armed groups
such as Daech or Boko HaramIn his report, the Secretary-General identifies six priorities responsibility to protect
for the next decade. We support these priorities without reservationWe share in particular and this is my second point, the recommendation of the Secretary
General that prevention must become the rule and not the exception. In this context,
We welcome the publication by the Office of Special Advisers to the prevention of genocide and
for the responsibility to protect the analytical framework of criminal atrocities. We hope this
analytical framework will be integrated into all United Nations peacekeeping activities,
including the training provided to UN staff before deployment and the
theaters of operations. To implement the responsibility to protect all United Nations actors
must play their part and links should be forged with other cross-cutting themes such

the initiative "Human Rights First".

The Commission of peacebuilding in as a contribution to make, since it
intended to prevent the resurgence of conflict and to prevent the recurrence of atrocities. Luxembourg
is committed in the context of peacebuilding alongside Guinea, in order to promote
national reconciliation and strengthen its state institutionsFinally, and this is my third point, we have to react more strongly and more quicklyThe unprecedented crisis prevailing in Syria since March 2011 and whose impact on the region and au
Beyond the region continues to worsen, following the displacement of millions of men, women and
children, shows how difficult it is for the international community to react
prompt and decisive when the Security Council is blocked.

The primary responsibility of maintaining peace and international security was granted to
Security Council "gr to ensure prompt and effective action of the Organization", in the words of the Charter
United Nations. The paralysis of the Council when populations are threatened with horrific crimes
goes against the Charter. For this reason, we welcome and support the initiative launched by the
France to ensure that the permanent members of the Security Council to refrain from using
veto in cases of mass atrocities. Beyond the permanent members of the Council, all states
members must take responsibility. We therefore encourage all Member States to
support the Code of Conduct concerning action by the Security Council against genocide,
crimes against humanity or war crimes, code of conduct developed by the ACT Group -
Accountability, Consistency, Transparency - and which Luxembourg is a member. So does our
