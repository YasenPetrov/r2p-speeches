Mr president
Jordan joins the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Egypt to the United Nations on behalf of a group of States
Non-Aligned. Let me extend my thanks to the President of the General Assembly to be held for dialogue is thematic
The official on the implementation of the responsibility to protectJordan welcomes the beginning of the report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, entitled "Implementation of the responsibility to protect"
And it is seen as an important step to establish a joint convictions contribute to opening an effective formal dialogue in the General Assembly
about this subject.

Based on our conviction that history in the dark side »should not repeat itself and that the humanitarian massacres
Experienced human must not Ttakerra the Jordan as a member of the International Criminal Court fully believes in the importance of this
The concept and the priority given by the international community to implement it. My delegation is ready to engage fully with
All parties and at all levels to reach a plan of action given by everyone and allow us to put this
Concept into practiceMr. Alriams
Jordan believes that paragraphs 138 and 139 of the Final Document of the World Summit in 2005
Constitute a political and moral basis for building a solid system agreed the protection of internationally through the United Nations »and reflect
For an international consensus to build this system of responsibility for protection.

Jordan confirms the site of international law in conflict prevention and treatment implications Allehae Based
To this principle, Jordan is a founding member of the International Criminal Court »as well as keen to join
All international conventions dealing with violence, genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against
HumanityMr president
Jordan looks very seriously to the Secretary-General of the three Barakaizha strategy and circumstances of the four also received
In the document. As a general principle in the responsibility for the protection of my Government emphasizes the importance of dialogue to prevent
Conflicts and to promote preventive measures that reduce the occurrence of these crimes and the peaceful use of tools and focus on
Peacekeeping operations and then respond to non-coercive measures. Mr president
My delegation believes that the adoption and implementation of the Secretary-General's strategy requires an open dialogue between everyone and transparent
And that this dialogue must respond to the concerns of the broad membership of the United Nations. We believe that the Assembly's discussions
General for the next stage on the implementation of this concept should focus on the following aspects:
- the core issue: taking into account the concerns of 5 Eah 20: his main concern countries concerns about the potential of abuse
Concept outside its framework specified in paragraphs 138 and 139 of the Final Document of the 2005 summit and remove the impression that
Concept is automatically linked to foreign intervention and the use of military force and emphasized that the scope of implementation is limited to
The four cases approved by the strategy. Any attempt to expand the scope of this strategy will threaten to undermine
Concept and cast doubt on the chances of success.

- The second issue: The success of the application of this concept is linked to a large extent the credibility of Alastrennigah and its ability to
Steadfastness and avoid the cases of selectivity and double standards. Political considerations and interests interlocks
The contrasting influencing decision-making process will pose a real threat to the seriousness of the international community in the implementation of
Responsibility for protection. The concept that does not apply to single standards do not gain credibility required for its success
And respect for peoples Aictsp- The third issue: Jordan supports the statement in the Secretary-General's strategy with regard to the establishment of an early warning system but
We believe that the massacres and war crimes committed did not occur because of the absence of signals and information provided by the system
Early warning but because of the insistence of the parties to the conflict to commit massacres and the absence of the political will of the community
International to prevent it and stop it. Therefore, the establishment and development of the political will of the international community in isolation from the interests
Political Contrasting located in the heart of the strategy and constitutes one of the most important ingredients for success.

- Alqdah_alrabah: Jordan, by virtue of its membership in a group of five small countries 5-5: »and membership in
The International Criminal Court, it has always advocated the need to refrain from the use of the veto in the four cases
It referred responsibility for the protection strategy. Even Secretary-General is gaining momentum and writes a real strategy
It has a reasonable chance of success, my delegation associates itself with the appeal made by the Secretary-General on this ModouhThe need to abstain five permanent members of the Security Council on the use of the veto in the four cases
Defined strategy.

Mr president
Jordan stresses the need for the continuation of the General Assembly to continue its consideration of this issue and to open the door
Dialogue Besddhae and shed more light on the role of the Human Rights Council; and the Peacebuilding Commission »
Economic and Social Council in the implementation of the tasks required to embody the concept of responsibility to protect. My delegation believes that the national responsibility of States is the real criterion which must be based on him this
Strategy and our means to maximize this responsibility lies in the second pillar of (international assistance and building
The capacities of States). This is why the establishment of the international community to double its investment in (time and resources) in the second pillar
It will inevitably lead to enhance the chances of success of the strategy of the Secretary-General
