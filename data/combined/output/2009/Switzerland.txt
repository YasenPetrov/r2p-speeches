Unofficial Enalish translation
Mr President,
Switzerland welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-General to operationalise the responsibility
to protect on the basis of the consensus of September 2005. 1 would like to thank him for the
presentation two days ago of the report under review. It is vital that we should continue
together to ensure that the notion of "sovereignty as responsibility" is translated into specific
action that is measurable on the ground, respects human life and conforms to the decision
that we took four years ago to act on behalf of this causeAs the Secretary-General points out, the concept of responsibility to protect is an ally of that
of sovereignty. It therefore needs to be considered in the strict framework of paragraphs 138
and 139 of the Outcome document and on the basis of the narrow but deep approach
proposed by the Secretary-General. This approach, which is enshrined in the United Nations
Charter, is distinct from the so-called "humanitarian" interventions, and we are committed to
ensuring that this distinction will be clearly maintained.

The report under review today is a major instrument of political mobilisation which enables
each State and the international community as a whole to familiarise themselves with the
instruments available to prevent mass atrocities. This cataloguing should enable us to
achieve greater coherence in our undertakings. It should also lead us to consider all the
preventive and assistance measures available before, as a last resort, using the measures
set out in the Third Pillar to stop mass atrocities against a civilian populationMr President,
I would like to mention a number of aspects that may help us continue our discussions about
the responsibility to protect.

Firstly, it is important to stress that the obligations of States with regard to international law
exist regardless of the emergence of a situation in which the concept of responsibility to
protect may come into play. These obligations cannot and must not be diluted. It should also
be emphasised that although the concept contains numerous existing international law
obligations, it remains a political concept and does not in itself constitute a new norm. Nor
does it have the effect of dispensing States from their conventional and customary law
obligations with regard to human rights law, international humanitarian law and refugee law.

Secondly, a clear distinction needs to be maintained between the concept of responsibility to
protect and that of the protection of civilians. To do this, it is essential to define proactively
the specific features of each concept and their field of application. For example it should be
stressed that the protection of civilians deals with the entire set of rights of civilians, not only
the international crimes covered by the responsibility to protect. The progress achieved in the
area of protection of civilians is very important and is derived from humanitarian principles. It
is essential to maintain this and to continue to make improvements within this framework.

Thirdly, as we have said, the instruments presented are for the most part well knownHowever, what is lacking at this stage is reflection on what did not work when these
instruments were used in the past. We know that the problem is not usually the lack of
information. It is the absence of political will at the right time that is at the heart of our past
failures. One important means of remedying this would be for the permanent members of the
Security Council to refrain from using their veto in cases of genocide, crimes against
humanity, ethnic cleansing and war crimes. It is also important that they should help to
strengthen the acquis in the area of the fight against impunity as part of a general policy of
prevention. For its part the General Assembly should continue to work towards the
implementation of the responsibility to protect and should mobilise the international
community as a whole to implement it.

Finally, paragraph 50 of the report, in accordance with paragraph 139 of the Outcome
document, calls on the United Nations to carry out determined collective action and not to
follow arbitrary and graduated procedures that prize form over substance and process over
results. In this context, we will need to consider the most effective way of implementing the
Third Pillar. Several questions are still pending: what is the threshold of intervention for
"timely and decisive" response? Who is responsible for deciding on whether a situation
constitutes genocide, a crime against humanity, ethnic cleansing or a war crime? In
particular, how can the General Assembly and the Secretary-General offer complementary
solutions to those of the Council or in the event of deadlock within the Council? How can the
accountability of the Council be strengthened? We believe that the follow-up of the
recommendation in paragraph 62 of the report - an invitation to review the principles, rules
and doctrines which should guide the use of force in the extreme situations concerning this
concept - could contribute to this reflection-*
Mr President,
We should be actuated not only by the obligation to respect but also to ensure the respect of
international law, so that humanity can continue to regard the UN as the best guarantor of
international peace and security. The responsibility to protect concerns the international
community as a whole
