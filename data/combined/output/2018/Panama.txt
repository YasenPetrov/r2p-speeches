(spoke in Spanish):
At the outset, I would like to express our appreciation
for the significant progress that this formal debate
represents as the first on the responsibility to protect
after almost a decade. We are also grateful to the
representatives of Australia and Ghana for their
leadership in this processPanama aligns itself with the statement made by
the representative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of
Friends of the Responsibility to Protect (see A/72/
PV.99), and consequently reaffirms its commitment
to the three pillars of the responsibility to protect and
our collective responsibility to protect our people from
the scourge of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity, as established at the 2005
World Summit.

We welcome the formal inclusion of this item on
the agenda of the seventy-second session of the General
Assembly and the focus on prevention proposed by
the Secretary-General in his report of 1 June 2018
(A/72/884), with regard to the priority role of early
warning and subsequent timely action that States are
called upon to ensure. The report’s recommendations are
very important to fulfilling the primary responsibility
to protectThe current debate on the need to preserve and
strengthen multilateralism as the most effective way to
address global challenges in the areas of human rights,
development, migration and refugee crises, among
others, is becoming increasingly important and requires
collective efforts to create an atmosphere of trust, in
the interests of the most vulnerable populations. The
leadership that the international community, primarily
the United Nations, and in particular the Security
Council, is called on to show in addressing the growing
threats to international peace and security in a timely
manner and in accordance with the principles of the
Charter of the United Nations is essential to building
credibility and trust among people.

There is no doubt that the decisions taken by
the Security Council are crucial to the agenda of
the prevention of atrocity crimes. Given its primary
responsibility for ensuring international peace and
security, timely action in the decision-making of the
Security Council, chiefly on the part of the permanent
members, is critical to preventing acts of genocide, war
crimes and crimes against humanityIn that regard and bearing in mind that human
rights can lead nations on a path to peace and security,
in 2015 Panama joined the French-Mexican initiative in
support of suspending the use of the veto in the Security
Council in cases of mass atrocities, as well as the code
of conduct promoted by the Accountability, Coherence
and Transparency group, because we share the belief
that situations of mass atrocities are unacceptable from
any point of view, and contrary to the spirit that gave
rise to our Organization. Similarly, in searching for the
best way to address the issue, we stress the importance
of the words of the Secretary-General’s report on the
need for the United Nations to reflect on cases where
it has failed and to examine its success stories, so that
they can also be considered in the detection of cases
of risk, and so that the principle of early warning can
become the Organization’s principal raison d’être.

With regard to national efforts, States must commit
to using the broadest possible range of international
instruments for prohibiting and preventing atrocity
crimes and protecting their peoples. As a country
whose international policy rests on the protection of
fundamental rights, Panama has therefore formalized
its deposit of its instrument of ratification of the
Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute, and has
thereby strengthened its national legal framework and
its commitment to the international community, of
which accountability is a crucial elementWhile we reiterate that the primary responsibility
to protect lies with States, the constructive participation
of other actors in promoting action by civil society and
thereby building cohesive and inclusive societies, is an
added value in the focus on prevention. Accordingly,
and in support of national capacities, the active role
of civil society and the empowerment of women, girls
and young people as agents of change are becoming
increasingly important in promoting and strengthening
peaceful societies and preventing and settling conflictsThere is a pressing need for a paradigm shift in which
accountability, capacity-building and political will
prevail, together with ethical values, to ensure that our
actions are not only just but are also effectively aimed
at protecting populations at risk..

In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Panama’s
commitment to the protection of all human rights
and the elimination of all forms of discrimination
