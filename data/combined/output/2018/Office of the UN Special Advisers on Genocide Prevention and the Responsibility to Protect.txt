Statement by Adama Dieng, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide,
on the conviction of NUON Chea and KHIEU Samphan for the crime of genocide, crimes
against humanity and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions by the
Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia
(New York, 16 November 2018) The United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of
Genocide, Adama Dieng, welcomed today’s decision by the Trial Chamber of the Extraordinary
Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, holding accountable two former senior leaders of the
Khmer Rouge for crimes committed in Cambodia from 17 April 1975 to 6 January 1979.

The two former Khmer Rouge leaders, NUON Chea, former Deputy Secretary of the Communist
Party of Kampuchea (CPK) and KHIEU Samphan, former Head of State of Democratic
Kampuchea, were sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of genocide against the
Vietnamese minority in Cambodia. NUON Chea was also convicted for the crime of genocide
against the Cham ethnic and religious minority, based on his superior responsibility. Both men
were convicted for grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the crimes against
humanity of murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, persecution
on political, religious and racial grounds and other inhumane acts against civilians in Cambodia
during this period.

“This conviction is a good day for justice”. Special Adviser Adama Dieng said. “It demonstrates
that justice will prevail, and that impunity should never be accepted for genocide and other
atrocity crimes.”
Special Adviser Adama Dieng also expressed his support and solidarity with the victims. He
said, “all the people who have suffered as a result of the heinous crimes committed by the Khmer
Rouge in Cambodia during this period have waited a long time for justice, hopefully this
decision will provide them with some measure of redress and solace.”
Special Adviser Adama Dieng further stressed the importance of this decision for prevention.

“While criminal accountability is foremost a tool to provide justice and redress to victims, it also
has an important preventative function as a deterrent as well as to help societies in reconciliation
efforts and to deal with the past. At a time when we are witnessing a dangerous disregard for
fundamental rights and international legal norms and standards in many parts of the world, this
decision sends a strong message, in the region and globally, to those who commit, incite or
condone atrocity crimes that sooner or later they will be held accountable.”

UNITED NATIONS
PRESS RELEASE
For immediate release
Statement by Adama Dieng, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide,
on the decision of the International Criminal Court Pre-Trial Chamber on the jurisdiction
over the crime of deportation of the Rohingya population from Myanmar.

(New York, 07 September 2018) The United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of
Genocide, Adama Dieng, welcomes the decision issued yesterday by the International Criminal
Court (ICC), Pre-Trial Chamber I, in which it concluded that the Court has jurisdiction over the
alleged deportation of members of the Rohingya people from Myanmar to Bangladesh.

Deportation can constitute a crime against humanity under international law. The Chamber also
ruled that the Court would have jurisdiction over other crimes committed, such as the crime of
persecution, if at least one element of the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court - or part of
such a crime - has been committed on the territory of a State Party to the Statute.

“This decision is a light in what has been a very dark episode for the Rohingya people this past
year” said the Special Adviser. The decision followed a request by the Prosecutor of the ICC on
9 April 2018, in which she sought a ruling from the Pre-Trial Chamber on the jurisdiction of the
Court in a situation in which persons are deported from the territory of a State which is not party
to the Rome Statute of the ICC into the territory of a State which is a party to the Statute. While
Myanmar is not a party to the Statute, Bangladesh is. Accordingly, the decision opens the door to
the prosecution of some of the crimes that may have been committed against the Rohingya.

“The crimes allegedly committed or initiated in Myanmar against the Rohingya population,
particularly since August 2017, which led to the mass displacement of almost a million Rohingya
people into Bangladesh, are horrific and must not go unpunished,” insisted the Special Adviser.

“We have all heard the shocking reports of mass killings, the gang rape of women, of babies
being thrown into fires, and the complete destruction of villages. The failure of the Security
Council to refer the situation to the ICC for investigation, despite credible information to support
these allegations and numerous calls for accountability, has been frustrating, to say the least”.

The Special Adviser also noted that while the decision issued yesterday is a breakthrough,
alleged crimes perpetrated solely on the territory of Myanmar, including conduct that could
possibly amount to the crime of genocide, will be excluded from the jurisdiction of the ICC. For
that reason, the Special Adviser urged the international community to continue its efforts to bring
justice to the Rohingya people.

The Special Adviser also urged ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to consider the recommendation
of the Chamber to decide on the opening of an investigation into the situation without delay. He
concluded: “The decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber provides victims an opportunity to access
justice for some of the crimes they have endured, which is an important first step. Myanmar has
refused to cooperate with any impartial investigation into the matter and continues to insist
hiding behind its sovereign borders. It is about time that countries understand that borders are not
strong enough to protect those involved in the most horrible crimes committed against human
beings from prosecution.”

UNITED NATIONS
PRESS RELEASE
For immediate release

Statement by Adama Dieng, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide
on the decision by the Republika Srpska National Assembly to revoke endorsement of the
2004 Srebrenica Commission Report
(New York, 16 August 2018) The United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of
Genocide, Adama Dieng, raised concern at the 14 August decision by the Republika Srpska
National Assembly to revoke its endorsement of the 2004 Srebrenica Commission Report.

“Rejection of the Commission’s findings is a step backwards for Bosnia and Herzegovina. It
undermines the rule of law and national and international efforts to achieve justice for victims of
crimes committed against people of all ethnicities during the 1992-1995 Bosnian war. In
addition, given the timing of this decision, it is likely to exacerbate tensions ahead of the 7
October elections and damage prospects for long term stability and reconciliation.”
The Commission, which was set up by the Republika Srpska Government in 2003, found that
from 10 to 19 July 1995, between 7,000 and 8,000 Bosnian Muslims went missing in Srebrenica
and established that more than 1,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, constituting a serious
violation of international humanitarian law. Many of the findings of the Commission have been
verified and confirmed by the verdicts of international, domestic, and foreign courts. Two
international courts, the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia, have determined that the massacre of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica
constituted genocide.

During his visit to the Balkans in February 2018, Special Adviser Dieng observed that “It is
evident that events of the past are being used for political purposes. Mistrust and outright
hostility between political leaders representing different constituencies is preventing any
significant progress towards reconciliation.” He raised concern at the rejection of judicial
verdicts, glorification of war criminals and their crimes, the appointment of convicted war
criminals to public functions and the negative impact that these developments would have on
prospects for reconciliation in the country.

UNITED NATIONS
PRESS RELEASE
For immediate release
Statement by Adama Dieng, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide
on the situation in Hudaydah, Yemen
(New York, 14 June 2018) The United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide,
Adama Dieng, expressed grave concern at the potentially disastrous impact on civilians of the
military offensive against the port of Hudaydah, launched on 13 June by pro-government forces
backed by Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE), against Houthi fighters who have
been holding the port.

Yemen is currently considered to be the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with 10.4 million
people at risk of famine and Hudaydah is the entry point for seventy per cent of humanitarian
aid. In addition to the destruction that the offensive is likely to cause – and the risk to the
estimated 600,000 civilians who live in and around the port - closing the port for any length of
time could have a disastrous impact on the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver assistance
to a population that desperately needs it.

“Starvation of civilians as a method of war is a war crime and was condemned by the Security
Council in resolution 2417 of 24 May 2018. It seems that the first test of this resolution is
Yemen: the Yemeni port of Hudaydah is a lifeline for the delivery of aid and the Coalition’s air
strikes can kill many more people over time through famine and hunger when damaging such
civilian infrastructure.”
Special Adviser Dieng fully supports the call by the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for
Yemen, Martin Griffiths, for all parties to the conflict to exercise restraint and to find a political
solution to the conflict, stressing that there can be no military solution.

He called on the parties to uphold their obligations under international law in the conduct of
hostilities, in particular the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution. “Attacks
that are indiscriminate or directly target civilians or civilian objects may constitute war crimes.

All the parties to the conflict, as well as the international community, have a responsibility to
protect populations from atrocity crimes in Yemen.”
The Special Adviser called for accountability for alleged violations of international humanitarian
and human rights law committed during the conflict in Yemen.

UNITED NATIONS
PRESS RELEASE
For immediate release
Statement by Adama Dieng, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide,
on his visit to Bangladesh to assess the situation of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar
(Dhaka, 13 March 2018) From 7 to 13 March I visited Bangladesh to assess the situation of the
Rohingya population who have crossed the border from Myanmar to Bangladesh since the most
recent incidents of violence in northern Rakhine state in October 2016 and August 2017. During
my visit, I had the opportunity to meet Bangladeshi authorities, civil society actors and members
of the diplomatic community. I also visited refugee camps in Cox’s Bazaar, where survivors I
met shared horrifying stories of what they have endured.

What I have heard and witnessed in Cox’s Bazaar is a human tragedy with the fingerprints of the
Myanmar government and of the international community. The scorched earth campaign carried
out by the Myanmar security forces since August 2017 against the Rohingya population was
predictable and preventable. Despite the numerous warnings I have made of the risk of atrocity
crimes, the international community has buried its head in the sand. This has cost the Rohingya
population of Myanmar their lives, their dignity and their homes.

Let us be clear: international crimes were committed in Myanmar. Rohingya Muslims have been
killed, tortured, raped, burnt alive and humiliated, solely because of who they are. All the
information I have received indicates that the intent of the perpetrators was to cleanse northern
Rakhine state of their existence, possibly even to destroy the Rohingya as such, which, if proven,
would constitute the crime of genocide. However, whether or not we consider that the crimes
committed amount to crimes against humanity or genocide, this should not delay our resolve to
act and to act immediately. We owe this to the Rohingya population.

First, the root causes of the problem must be addressed. Only then can this population return in
safety and dignity to Myanmar. The fate of the Rohingya has been sealed since the day they were
born. A fate of persecution and exclusion. We must change this and give them the opportunity
that every human being should be afforded in life: to enjoy their fundamental human rights in
freedom and safety. The recommendations of the Rakhine Advisory Commission provide a road
map for the Myanmar Government. As a priority the stateless status of the Rohingya community
must end and the issue of their citizenship be addressed properly and definitively.

Second, there must be accountability for the crimes that have been committed. I am perplexed by
the denial of the widespread commission of serious crimes that has characterized the response of
the Myanmar authorities. I urge the international community, in particular the United Nations
Security Council, to consider different accountability options. The world needs to show that it is
not ready to tolerate such barbaric acts.

Third, the Rohingya must receive protection and support as refugees while in Bangladesh. I
welcome the remarkable work done by the Bangladeshi authorities in responding to the arrival of
almost 700,000 Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar in the space of six months. I call on the
international community to do more to support Bangladesh in shouldering this responsibility by

providing support to the refugees and host communities. The social and economic strains and the
environmental impact that this influx of refugees is placing on the area and the host community
is clearly visible. I encourage the Bangladesh government to facilitate more dialogue between the
two communities to avoid misperceptions and the build-up of tension.

I was encouraged by the commitment made by the Bangladeshi authorities I met that refugees
would not be repatriated against their will. What I have heard and seen makes it clear that the
majority of the Rohingya want to return to Myanmar, but only when they are able to do so in
safety, dignity and with access to the basic rights that are fundamental to us all. So far, the
Myanmar authorities have shown no genuine efforts to allow this. In fact, refugees continue to
cross the border. It is imperative also that the Rohingya, while in Bangladesh, are afforded more
chances to uplift themselves educationally and through access to livelihoods. Doing so will help
them both in Bangladesh and when they are able to return to Myanmar.

We must not fail the Rohingya population again. They have endured what no human beings
should have to endure. The solution to this problem lies first and foremost with the Myanmar
authorities, by creating the conditions for the Rohingya population to return home in safety and
be entitled to the same rights as any other citizen of Myanmar. The international community also
has a responsibility to protect this population from the risk of further atrocity crimes. Under the
present conditions, returning to Myanmar will put the Rohingya population at risk of further
crimes. However, accepting the current status quo would be a victory for those who planned the
attacks. We must not accept either of these scenarios.

UNITED NATIONS
PRESS RELEASE
For immediate release
Statement by Adama Dieng, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide
on his visit to the region of the Western Balkans
(Sarajevo, 12 February 2018) – United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide
Adama Dieng concluded today a twelve-day visit to the region of the Western Balkans. The visit
included Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In these four States, the
Special Adviser met high level government officials, including cabinet members, heads of
parliament and national prosecutors; religious leaders; representatives of civil society
organizations as well as members of the diplomatic community. Special Adviser Dieng also held
meetings with representatives of the United Nations Country Teams in the region and the United
Nations Office in Belgrade.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he placed a special focus in light of the upcoming October 2018
general elections and the increase in political tensions, the Special Adviser met government
officials at State and entity levels in Sarajevo and in Banja Luka. They included, among others,
members of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency Ivanić and Izetbegović; Minister of Foreign
Affairs Crnadak; Minister for Human Rights and Refugees Borovac; Republika Srpska entity
President Dodik; and Federation of Bonia and Herzegovina entity President Čavara. He also met
members of the Speakers Collegium of both parliamentary chambers. Special Adviser Dieng paid
tribute to the victims of past atrocity crimes with visits to memorial sites in Srebrenica and in
Donja Gradina. He also visited the Partisan Memorial Cemetery in Mostar.

In the four States, the Special Adviser explored existing challenges for reconciliation as well as
opportunities to overcome them. He expressed concern at the presence of a number of factors that
could lead to scenarios of further polarization unless serious and concerted efforts are taken to
address them, primarily by political leaders but also by civil society actors and by the international
community. Concerns include political polarization across identity lines and politicization of
events in the past, including glorification of war criminals, contestation of court decisions and
limited engagement in transitional justice and national reconciliation. He also expressed concern
at the absence of shared narrative of events in the past and what he considered as limited political
interest in promoting such understanding.

Special Adviser Dieng called on political leaders to take active steps to overcome divisions and to
maximize common ground. He specifically encouraged them to overcome existing trust deficits
by focusing on the future and by prioritizing reconciliation as a fundamental policy objective for
the region. This includes strengthening efforts to advance transitional justice and accountability
agendas by expediting implementation of legislation addressing genocide denial, glorification of
war crimes and hate speech, as well as by harmonizing domestic provisions on civilian victims of
atrocity crimes, among others. He appealed for recognition of the suffering of all victims
irrespective of their ethnic or religious origin, including through joint participation by political
leaders in memorialization events. He praised the courage of victims’ associations in advancing
accountability in the region. He also underlined the important role of religious leaders and actors

in promoting reconciliation, as well as the importance of empowering the youth with sustained
efforts to promote inclusive education.

In his meetings with government officials, the Special Adviser also encouraged further
strengthening joint agendas in fields where cooperation already exists. These include prosecution
of war crimes and regionalization of the joint United Nations and Bosnia and Herzegovina
Presidency Dialogue for the Future initiative. He also shared the view that the implementation of
the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, particularly Sustainable Development Goal 16,
constitutes a key instrument for prevention as it addresses drivers and root causes of instability and
conflict.

In his meetings with representative of the diplomatic community in the region, Special Adviser
Dieng called for concerted and sustained efforts to prioritize reconciliation and prevention. This is
particularly important in light of ongoing efforts by Western Balkan States to achieve European
Union membership. This organization’s renewed focus on this region provides a new opportunity
for prioritization of the reconciliation agenda. Special Adviser Dieng intends to further emphasize
this message in his bilateral interactions with relevant Member States.
