(spoke in Spanish): The
Chilean delegation would like to express special thanks
to the delegations of Australia and Ghana today for
their efforts and dedication. It is their commitment that
has led us to hold this debate in the General AssemblyChile supported the recommendation to include the
responsibility to protect as an item on the Assembly’s
agenda. We also called for respect for the work of the
Organization itself in the framework of its principles
and prerogatives, with the aim of according priority
to the rights of victims and ensuring their dignity;
putting an end to impunity; promoting the participation
of civil society and local communities, among
other stakeholders; and enhancing strategic United
Nations communication in the interest of achieving
greater transparency.

We therefore welcome the Secretary-General’s most
recent report on the issue, entitled “Responsibility to
protect: from early warning to early action” (A/72/884),
and highlight the fact that his recommendations
dovetail with the other major processes under way in
our Organization. We believe that this is an excellent
opportunity for us all to throw our weight behind
the responsibility to protect from the perspective of
prevention, given that we are now in the middle of a
reform process. In addition, we must work to construct
and promote resilient and cohesive societiesIn this context, we would like to strongly emphasize,
as the Secretary-General does in his report, the
important role of women in the prevention of atrocity
crimes, since it can be a key element in early-warning
and peacebuilding processes as well as in promoting
cooperation, capacity-building and support networks at
the local, regional and international levelsWe know we cannot rewrite history, but we can
learn from it. Our collective actions regarding the
responsibility to protect must go hand in hand with
reliable and timely information, so that the decisions
we take are responsible, transparent and focused on
a single objective, which is the ethical imperative of
protecting people from the four atrocity crimes covered
by the responsibility to protect..

Likewise, we are convinced that a united effort on
the part of the United Nations and the strengthening
of multilateralism are the most effective tools we have
for the maintenance of order, peace and international
security and, in the specific case of the responsibility
to protect, for preventing failed decision-making from
scarring humankind forever
