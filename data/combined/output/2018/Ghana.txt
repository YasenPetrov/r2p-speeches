I join previous speakers
in thanking the Secretary-General for his excellent
report on the responsibility to protect (A/72/884). We
are encouraged by the report’s focus on early warning
and the means of strengthening early action through a
threefold strategy and approach to the implementation
of the responsibility to protectMy delegation aligns itself with the statement
delivered earlier by the Permanent Representative
of Qatar on behalf of the Group of Friends on the
Responsibility to ProtectI would like to recall that Ghana and Australia
called for the inclusion of this subject on the agenda
of the General Assembly and for the formalization of
our debate on this important principle by reason of our
conviction that sincere and transparent dialogue, devoid
of dramatization, would allow for building consensus
on the responsibility to protect.

At the outset, I want to reiterate Ghana’s view that
the principle of the responsibility to protect remains
relevant, both as an expression of political commitment
and as a blueprint for action to prevent and end
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. We
support the framework for the implementation of the
responsibility to protect based on the three equal and
mutually reinforcing pillars of the principle, namely the
primary obligation of States to protect their peoples, the
collective responsibility of the international community
in those efforts, and strategies to ensure the timely and
decisive collective responses necessary to effectively
meet the principle’s laudable objectives, in accordance
with the Charter of the United Nations.

Ghana believes that the implementation of the
responsibility to protect through enhanced national,
regional and global collaboration on effective
prevention strategies would contribute to prioritizing
the Organization’s prevention agenda and strengthen
accountability for atrocity crimes. We endorse the
position that the pace of implementation can be improved
through strengthened mechanisms for accountability
across the legal, moral and political spheres, together
with clearly defined relationships between the three
phases of the principleMy delegation also finds merit in the Brazilian
initiative on responsibility while protecting, as it
provides clarity in the strategy for implementing the
responsibility to protect, particularly in relation to
accountability and transparency. Going by the most
recent developments, that already appears to be a
promising direction for reaching desired outcomes in
the implementation of the responsibility to protect.

Building resilience at the community, national,
regional and global levels involves developing
functional institutions of good governance at all levelsThey must be anchored in a robust human rights
regime and driven by the principles of local ownership,
transparency, dialogue and inclusiveness, respect for
diversity, accountability, equity, the rule of law and
solidarity. In addition, building stability and resilience
in transitional societies also requires a cautious and
deliberate balance between retributive and restorative
justice. In our view, good governance guarantees
national stability and peace, which are authentic marks
of State sovereigntyMy delegation shares the view that regional and
subregional arrangements can help to further develop
capacities for early warning and assessment of atrocity
crimes through a review of their current response
capacities and the support they give to their respective
member States. In that regard, we wish to stress that
national ownership of regional strategies is a sine
qua non for sustainable and transforming action in
the responsibility to protect. We have learned from
situations that have played out in parts of Africa and the
Middle East that acts of omission or commission at the
national and regional levels are critical in determining
whether prevention and robust ex post facto intervention
will be effective or will be underminedIt is worth mentioning that the African Union,
at its fiftieth anniversary summit in 2013 in Addis
Ababa, undertook to promote a holistic and systematic
approach towards attaining the 2020 target of a
conflict-free Africa. African States have therefore
committed to the speedy implementation of existing
instruments of human rights, rule of law, democracy,
elections and good governance. The strategic Conflict
Prevention Framework of the Economic Community of
West African States, under implementation since 2007,
and the Monrovia Declaration, on the development
of capacity in mediation efforts, are also particularly
relevant in that regard.
