Vice-President, took the ChairFrance believes that the Geneva-based institutions
and mechanisms are also essential in preventing and
responding to mass crimes, whether through the
Universal Periodic Review or the regular briefings of
the Security Council by the High Commissioner for
Human RightsWhen we talk about the responsibility to protect,
we are not talking about a principle meant to divide;
we are talking about a compass to protect populationsThe responsibility to pronect is not in opposition

principle of action can always be enriched, and that is
where the United Nations and the whole international
community can play their key role. France will continue
to play its full part.
