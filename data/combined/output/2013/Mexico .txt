PERMANENT MISSION OF MEXICO
STATEMENT BY THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF MEXICO TO THE
UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION, Jorge Montano, IN DEBATE
INTERACTIVE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT
New York, September 11, 2013
Mr. president:
My delegation wishes to thank the President of the General Assembly to convene
This debate and the distinguished panelists who with their interventions have
set the tone of this important discussionWe also thank the Secretary General for his report,
focused on the first pillar of the Responsibility to Protect, ie the
responsibility of each State to prevent atrocities committed against their
populationMr. president:
There is no doubt that the heart of the Responsibility to Protect is precisely the
prevention, it is the only way to prevent people suffer atrocities,
holding them before they occur or making no recurrence where where and
They occurred. In this regard, the report of the Secretary-General provides a good point
starting to identify potential risk factors that may
triggering a humanitarian crisis. The more we know and understand the
causes that lead to conflict, better able to prevent and respond to this scenario
potential.

Perhaps the biggest challenge in prevention is so broad spectrum of application and
It is representing cross. It is therefore correct the distinction made by the Secretary
General in his report, including conflict prevention and prevention of atrocities. Yes
it is true that a climate of conflict can make you more susceptible commission
atrocities, history shows us that they also get to make in the absence
conflict. We agreed that "the heinous crimes are a process, not an event
I singled out. " This reflection is useful to address more adequately the causes
they could lead to perpetrate international crimes.

As we noted in the report, the extent of prevention necessarily implies
the commitment to work on different fronts, ranging from combating
discrimination and poverty, to strengthen the rule of law and in
particular human rights. Precisely the fifth risk factor identified
by the Secretary-General refers to weak legislative protection in
human rightsA respect, Mr. President, allow me to share the recent experience of my country
this area. In June 2011, after an extensive consultation process, Mexico approved
a momentous reform of the Constitution which was given constitutional status to
human rights contained in international treaties that my country is a party.

This reform not only reiterated the importance that Mexico attaches to human rights,
but also it involved strengthening the judiciary, responsible for ensuring
broader protection to individuals. Moreover, last week, the Supreme Court
confirmed on human rights the prevalence of international law in
cases in which it grants greater protection than the Constitution itselfHowever, for a true rule of law is consolidated, the strengthening
policy must be accompanied by institutional strengthening. Greater openness
democratic leads to greater transparency, greater involvement
civil society in decision-making, and greater accountability2
Regarding the participation of civil society, my delegation appreciates the
recognition is made in the report to the recent adoption of the Act
Persons Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists.

We're
convinced that the more extensive the participation of citizens, more
will be the solid social pact that would prevent conflicts and atrocitiesWith regard to the critical path that we must follow in the future, my Delegation
It considers that the measures proposed in paragraph 71 of the report, represent a
good basis to build prevention systemsHowever, we believe that you must also add the commitment of States
to favor the peaceful resolution of disputes. Acceptance, for example, the
jurisdiction of international tribunals, especially on human rights
and the International Criminal Court, will serve to deter the commission of atrocities.

Mr. president:
While we recognize that the guiding principle of our discussion is the report submitted by the
Secretary General, is inevitable in the current situation, addressing the humanitarian crisis in
the Syrian Arab Republic, where the conflict has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of
people, displaced a third of the population and more than two million
refugees, of whom half are children. Syria exemplifies one of the major challenges
prevention under the first pillar of the Responsibility to Protect
identified in the report: the lack of political willUnfortunately, the report we are discussing only regrets the failure to prevent
committing atrocities in that country, but it does an analysis of the failures
prevention system. This is a good time to reflect precisely
this in order to prevent recurrence of such shortcomings.

He invites discussion to think, for instance, if the situation we face today, had been
different with the implementation of the seven actions for prevention suggested in the
We note the report of the Secretary-General intends to address the second pillar
Responsibility to Protect in its next report. Since this relates to the

responsibility of the international community to use diplomatic means,
humanitarian and other peaceful means appropriate to prevent atrocities and crimes
international, we hope to continue the reflection process in order to identify
a list of lessons that allow us to reinvigorate the responsiveness
and avoid such dramatic crises in the future as it exists today in Syria. Mexico by
Meanwhile he continues to support and work for finding a peaceful solution and
effective to end the conflict in SyriaAt a critical moment as we live, we call honest to do
prevail conscience of humanity and international law, which has as
only objective the welfare of the Syrian people, bearing in mind that the
built responsibility to protect all.

Mr. president:
The value of the Responsibility to Protect lies in the enduring appeal to
need to take our protection obligations as entities organized and
governed by international law to aberrant acts such as crimes
War, genocide, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing
