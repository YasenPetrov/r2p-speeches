My delegation
has asked for the floor to explain Malaysia’s position
on resolution 73/304, entitled “Towards torture-free
trade: examining the feasibility, scope and parameters
for possible common international standards”.
Like most other countries, Malaysia is absolutely
against torture. We are supportive of the principles
behind the resolution. Nevertheless, my delegation
would like to point out a few areas of concern.
First, the approach that was taken in formulating
the resolution does not adhere to the rules of procedure
of the United Nations. Malaysia is of the opinion that
the resolution should have first been taken up by
the respective committees. In addition, the issue of
torture-free trade is more appropriately discussed by
colleagues in Geneva, as the matter concerns both trade
and human rights.
Secondly, the goods that the resolution refers to
have not been clearly defined. That may open a can
of worms, since items used for torture could include
weapons and almost anything that could be used as an
instrument of torture. Therefore, my delegation believes
that the resolution is still ambiguous in terms of what
it is targeting. On that basis, my delegation decided to
abstain in the voting on resolution 73/304. Nevertheless,
Malaysia is willing to engage in discussions to further
improve the resolution in the future.
