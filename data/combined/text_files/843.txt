(spoke in Arabic): As
everyone knows, Algeria abstained in the voting on
resolution 73/304. We did so for the following reasons.
First, Algeria is a party to most United Nations
conventions on human rights, including the Convention
against Torture. As is well known, torture is an
abhorrent crime that is unacceptable to humankind, and
particularly to the Algerian people, who have suffered
from colonialism, occupation, torture and genocide.
Algeria is therefore one of the first countries to
believe in opposing torture. We want the international
community to be free of this abhorrent crime.
Secondly, I would like to note and emphasize
that the Algerian delegation participated in all the
formal and informal meetings and consultations held
on the resolution. However, the approach taken by
the sponsors cannot be reconciled with the concerns
expressed by various delegations, including those that
have spoken in the Hall today. The sponsors did not
take into consideration the proposals made by various
delegations. A group of experts limited in scope led the
negotiations and consultations, whereas transparency
is one of the main principles of the United Nations;
all parties ought to be able to participate. We would
have preferred an open-ended group instead of a group
of experts.
Thirdly, we cannot agree with the position linking
torture and capital punishment: torture is subject to an
international convention, whereas capital punishment

is subject to the national jurisdiction of States. We
therefore cannot possibly agree with the approach taken
in resolution 73/304.
Finally, we stress that the principles of openness and
transparency must be applied in considering this matter.
Consultations should have included all delegations.
