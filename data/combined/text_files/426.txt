PRESS RELEASE
For immediate release

Statement by Adama Dieng, Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention
of Genocide, and Jennifer Welsh, Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the
Responsibility to Protect, on the situation in Iraq
(New York, 18 June 2014) The Special Advisers to the Secretary-General on the Prevention
of Genocide, Adama Dieng, and on the Responsibility to Protect, Jennifer Welsh, expressed
deep concern at the deterioration in the situation in Iraq and the impact on Iraq’s populations.
The Special Advisers strongly condemned reports of attacks against the lives and physical
integrity of civilians and other persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including
attacks by terrorist and armed groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
Such attacks are violations of international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes.
“The protection of civilians should be the primary focus of any strategy to address the current
situation”, stated the Special Advisers, who reiterated the United Nations Secretary-General’s
warning of the risk of further sectarian violence on a massive scale, within Iraq and beyond
its borders, noting that the use of sectarian rhetoric could further exacerbate the conflict.
The Special Advisers raised special concern at the situation of religious and other minorities,
noting that members of the Christian community were fleeing the northern city of Mosul en
masse following the ISIL-led invasion. Noting the reports of incitement to destroy Christian
churches, the Special Advisers underlined that: “Given the context of sectarian and
confessional polarisation in the country, special consideration must be given to assisting
religious and other minorities, which are particularly vulnerable”. The Special Advisers noted
that the reported capture of the town of Tal Afar in north-western Iraq raises concerns about
the well-being of Yazidis and other religious minorities living in the area.
They also reiterated the call by the United Nations Security Council for cooperation in the
delivery of humanitarian assistance, adding that: “It is key that the Government of Iraq and
Iraqi leaders from across the political spectrum work with the United Nations Assistance
Mission for Iraq and humanitarian agencies to ensure the delivery of urgently needed
humanitarian relief”.
The Special Advisers called on all parties involved in the crisis and on Iraqi leaders political, military, religious and community leaders – “to abandon strategies of violence and
confrontation, undertake all possible efforts to prevent sectarian reprisals amid the ongoing
violence and to engage constructively to ensure respect for diversity”. Finally, they also
stressed that all States have an obligation to ensure that measures taken to combat terrorism
comply with international law, in particular human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.
