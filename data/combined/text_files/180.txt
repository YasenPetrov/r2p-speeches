Denmark would like to align ourselves with the statements of the EU and the
Group of Friends of R2P, but we would like to make a few additional remarks
in our national capacity.
At the outset, we thank the Secretary General for his report which contains a
frank and important assessment of R2P, our challenges and of relevant country
situations. We also thank the Secretary General for his personal commitment
over the years to the prevention of R2P crimes. His reports and our annual
dialogues are important steps towards realizing the pledge made at the World
Summit in 2005.
On a much related point, we also applaud the Secretary General’s leadership on
the Human Rights Upfront initiative. We commend his efforts to improve the
system-wide capacity of the UN to prevent and respond to serious violations of
international human rights and humanitarian law. And as a candidate for the
UN Human Rights Council in 2019-2021, Denmark calls on the next Secretary
General to continue this important work and to work on further implementing
both R2P and Human Rights Up Front.
Let me also take this opportunity to thank and applaud the now former Special
Adviser on R2P, Jennifer Welsh for a job well done over the past nearly 3
years, and for the excellent mutual cooperation we have enjoyed.
We congratulate Assistant Secretary General Simonovic with his appointment
as the next Special Adviser. We could wish for no better man in this position to
carry on the work of promoting and protecting human rights and preventing
atrocity crimes.
Mr. Moderator,
Let me also reaffirm Denmark’s commitment to continue promoting and
implementing R2P. Prevention is at the heart of R2P and - as the new report by
the Secretary General rightly highlights - accountability for those committing
atrocity crimes needs to be a priority if we want to prevent their recurrence.

Allow me to share a couple of recent R2P initiatives that Denmark is involved
in.
In March this year, Denmark and the United States jointly organized a
workshop in Eastern Africa on the relationship between development
cooperation and R2P. The aim of the workshop was to train our own staff on
R2P issues, including early warning, and to better integrate R2P tools – such as
the Framework of Analysis – into practice. The workshop had participation
from several countries in the Eastern African region and provided valuable
insights on how atrocity prevention efforts can be integrated in development
cooperation. We are happy to share a report from the workshop with interested
partners and intend to work further on this kind of practical implementation of
R2P.
As regards our national implementation of R2P, Denmark has within our
government an R2P working group of relevant ministries and agencies to
discuss how to implement R2P within Denmark and in our international
relations. We also work with Danish civil society on the same question.
Denmark is always open to sharing the experiences with others bilaterally or in
the relevant fora, such as the Global R2P Focal Points Network. The Network
has now reached 55 Focal Points, including the recently appointed EU Focal
Point. We look forward to the continued efforts of the Network to strengthen
the implementation of R2P.
Thank you
