Statement delivered by Myanmarâ€“ Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2017
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]
Thank you, Mr. Moderator, and the President of the General Assembly for this important interactive
consultation taken out of the Sustainable Development Goals report on the issue of the Responsibility to
Protect and its various dimensions.
Myanmar understands the noble principles of prevention of atrocity crimes and the three pillars of the
Responsibility to Protect, yet these principles are used sometimes for political ends and needs to be
adopted through consensus. Since there have been a few mentions of the name linked to the situation in
Rakhine I am compelled to take the floor, Mr. Moderator. You must know we had no plans to commit
genocide or ethnic cleansing against any group of people. This is obvious as the number of people which
was accused of being subjected to genocide is growing and is expanding instead of disappearing. In fact,
it is the Rakhine ethnic nationals and other minorities in the area who have been driven out by extremist
elements; sometimes assisted by foreign entities and sometimes discrimination is created by those who
are there to provide assistance and necessarily doing more harm than do no harm as principles dictate.
On 25 August 2017, the extreme terrorist group the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) attacked
around 30 police posts and an army base in the township of the Rakhine state in Myanmar, which claimed
responsibility of these attacks. UN Security Council members have condemned these attacks.
