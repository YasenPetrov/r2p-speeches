H.E. AMBASSADOR CHARLES T. NTWAAGAE
PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANA
TO THE UNITED NATIONS

DURING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY INFORMAL INTERACTIVE
DIALOGUE ON THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT

“IMPLEMENTING THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT:
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PREVENTION”

CONFERENCE ROOM 4
UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS

6™ SEPTEMBER 2017
NEW YORK

Please check against deli very Mr. President,

. Let me at the outset join other delegations in applauding you for
convening this Annual Informal Interactive Dialogue of the
General Assembly on the Responsibility to Protect. The
principle of the Responsibility to Protect is of paramount importance
to humanity and as such it is endorsed by the General Assembly,
Security Council, Human Rights Council, regional and sub-regional
organisations, and civil society organisations.

. My delegation firmly believes that this dialogue will go a long way in
addressing the existing gaps that impede the effective
implementation of the Responsibility to Protect by suggesting
measures to close these gaps and to strengthen accountability for
atrocity crimes prevention.

. I would also like to seize this opportunity to commend our former
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and our current Secretary-General
Anténio Guterres for producing annual reports on different aspects of
the Responsibility to Protect for the nine consecutive years. In this
regard, I applaud Secretary-General Guterres for maintaining this
tradition.

. Botswana welcomes the first report of Secretary-General Guterres,
which is the ninth since 2009, aptly titled “Implementing the
Responsibility to Protect: Accountability for Prevention” to
reflect the primary responsibility of States to protect their populations
from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity, as well as their accountability for atrocity crimes
prevention.

. The Secretary-General’s Report highlights the challenges faced in
implementing the principle of Responsibility to Protect and
recommends measures that Member States, intergovernmental bodies and the United Nations system can adopt to strengthen
accountability for atrocity crimes prevention.

Mr. President,

6. This Report demonstrates that, despite the adoption of the principle
of the Responsibility to Protect in 2005, atrocity crimes continue
unabated. In this connection, Botswana reaffirms her commitment to
the principle of the Responsibility to Protect and pledges her support
to the efforts made by the President of the General Assembly, the
Secretary-General and the United Nations General Assembly to
advance this principle.

7. We also support initiatives that have been adopted in recent years to
strengthen atrocity crimes prevention such as:

e The Human Rights Up Front Initiative.
e The Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes.

e The Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) Group
Code of Conduct.

e The French and Mexican Initiative on Veto Restraint.

8. We endorse the measures proposed in the Secretary-General’s
Report, which, /nter alia, call for:

e Strengthening accountability for the implementation of the
Responsibility to Protect and ensuring rigorous and open
scrutiny of practice, based on agreed principles.

e Creating greater synergy among the three pillars of the United
Nations system, namely human rights, peace and security, and
development. e Integrating atrocity crimes prevention concerns into the work of
national human rights mechanisms.

e Ensuring accountability and redress for past and present
atrocity crimes.

9. To conclude, I am pleased to announce that Botswana has already
appointed a National Focal Point for the Responsibility to Protect and
an Ombudsman with a human rights mandate.

10.In line with the adage, “Prevention is better than cure,” we fully
support the Secretary-General that prevention of atrocity crimes
should be at the heart of the peace and security agenda of the
United Nations.

I thank you for your attention.
