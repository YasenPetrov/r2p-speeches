Statement delivered by the Delegation of Egypt to the United Nations, at the United
Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion "From commitment to
implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened by the President
of the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
25 February 2016
Notwithstanding the noble goals that the notion of Responsibility to Protect seeks to achieve,
namely the prevention of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing,
we nonetheless believe that the notion still contains serious political and legal gaps which, if
left unresolved and clearly undefined, and where attempts are pursued to hastily rush the
concept would actually do more harm than good with regards to the universality of the
Responsibility to Protect concept, rather than further its implementation as we all seek to
achieve.
As was shared by several other delegations today, Egypt believe that the informal interactive
dialogue has unfortunately been very much a monologue that has failed to address the
numerous concerns of member States in this regard. This is clearly illustrated by the numerous
requests put forth by the Egypt in these interactive dialogues asking the SG to delineate the
relationship between the three pillars and the issues of sequencing between them, to no avail.
In this regard, we still, and as much as many other countries, have legitimate concerns that
the notion of Responsibility to Protect may be manipulated for political objectives aimed at
intervening in the internal affairs of some member States.
Finally, an insistence to incorporate, in the discussion of Responsibility to Protect, notions and
concepts that are, at least, controversial and have not been subjected to the intergovernmental
process of negotiations before their adoption exacerbates this same feeling of mistrust
regarding the concept by some member States.
