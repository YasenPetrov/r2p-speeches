The General Assembly Informal Interactive Dialogue on the Report of the

Secretary-General on the “Responsibility to Protect”

Please check against delivery New York, 6 September 2017 Mr. Coordinator/Facilitator,

My delegation takes note of the Secretary-General’s report circulated in
document (S/2017/556). At the same time, it expresses its position on rejecting the
unilateral and unprofessional approach through which some Member States, in
coordination with some officials in the Secretariat, are attempting to misuse noble
humanitarian principles and politicize them in an unfair manner, leading to make
the “Responsibility to Protect" a serious controversial concept within the
framework of the United Nations. We recall again the catastrophic consequences
which have taken place in some countries, as a result of applying the “Responsibility
to Protect" unilaterally and selectively by some member states, which prompted
the former Secretary-General to acknowledge in one of his reports the concerns
raised by the misapplication of the “Responsibility to Protect” in one of these
countries.

In this context, my delegation expresses its concern of the retrogression in
the new report on the "Responsibility to Protect", as the authors of this report did
not observe the minimum standards of transparency, balance and professionalism,
by avoiding any indication to a wide divergence of views among Member States on
the criteria and guarantees of the application of the "Responsibility to Protect", and
by completely ignoring the substantive concerns and criticisms raised by many
Member States about the lack of guarantees and restrictions to ensure that the
“Responsibility to Protect" is not used as a justification for targeting the sovereignty
of member states and interfering in their internal affairs. Indeed, the authors of
this report have gone so far as to claim in the report that there is a global consensus
that "Responsibility to Protect" has become a recognized principle with its three

pillars, which is unrealistic at all. Those who read the minutes of the three informal dialogue sessions held this year in New York and Geneva, will realize that Member
States are still far from reaching real consensus in this matter.

The most serious matter in this regard is that the Secretariat, together with
some Member States, are still trying to exploit the Declaration adopted by Heads
of States and Governments at the 2005 Worid Summit, in order to create a non-
existent legal basis for “Responsibility to Protect”, With the aim of circumventing
the informal dialogue sessions and including this idea as an agenda item of the
General Assembly.

My delegation, along with many others, believes that both paragraphs 138
and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Declaration did not adopt or endorse
"Responsibility to Protect" as a principle, but emphasized basic and authentic
principles included in the Charter of the United Nations, regarding the maintenance
of international peace and security, the salvation of future generations from the
scourge of war, the belief in fundamental human rights and in the dignity of the
individual, the promotion of social progress, the promotion of the standard of living
in freedom, and above all the respect for the sovereignty of States and non-
interference in their internal affairs.

Based on these facts, my delegation considers that the request by Australia
and Ghana to include "Responsibility to Protect" as an agenda item of the General
Assembly during the next session, is a unilateral irresponsible act that breaches the
understanding which prevailed among all Member States to continue to consider
This issue as a part of the informal dialogue sessions. As a result, they both hold the
responsibility to deepen the situation of disagreement and to make this issue a

cause of division among member states. In conclusion, the Syrian Arab Republic stresses the need to continue to
examine this issue within the framework of the informal dialogue, and refuses to
include it as an agenda item of the General Assembly or to include any
supplementary item on it, before reaching consensus on the “Responsibility to
Protect” and the regulations and guarantees of not using it for political purposes
that contradict with the principles and purposes of the United Nations and its
Charter.

! also stress that the governments of some member states that support or
tolerate with terrorism in my country Syria, and that impose unilateral coercive
economic measures on the Syrian people, and that involve in illegal hostile military
actions within the so-called "international coalition" which bombs infrastructures
and kills civilians in Syria under the pretext of fighting "Daesh”.. these governments
are ineligible parties to claim defending human rights anywhere in the world,
considering the solid fact that they use humanitarian files to justify their
interference in the affairs of other States and to legitimize military intervention in

these states.

Thank you, Mr. Coordinator/facilitator
