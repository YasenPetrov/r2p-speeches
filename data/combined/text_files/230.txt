Statement delivered by the Delegation of Japan to the United Nations, at the United
Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion "From commitment to
implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened by the President
of the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
25 February 2016
Japan aligns itself with the statement made by [Rwanda] on behalf of the Group of Friends.
Since the adoption of the World Summit Outcome in 2005 the General Assembly has been
discussing this issues for over a decade, including six annual informal interactive dialogues
on this issue. Thanks to these discussions, held amongst the member States, the concept of
Responsibility to Protect has become clearer.
Sadly, during these ten years, we have failed to prevent many atrocities throughout the world.
We are discussing this issue of Responsibility to Protect with the aim to improve the situation
on the ground and prevent the atrocities. Therefore, we must start thinking seriously about
how we can implement Responsibility to Protect and find practical ways to prevent and end
atrocities. In this regard, we welcome the draft resolution on the Responsibility to Protect by
the cross-regional group.
Adopting the resolution, indeed, requires intergovernmental negotiation which many of our
colleagues desire. Through these discussions we support adopting the resolution in this
General Assembly session.
