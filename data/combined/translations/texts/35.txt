Statement by Adama Dieng, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and Ivan
Simonovic, United Nations Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect, on the situation in
northern Rakhine state, Myanmar

The United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, and the Special Adviser of
the Responsibility to Protect, Ivan Simonovic, call on the Government of Myanmar to take immediate action to
stop and address the commission of atrocity crimes that are reportedly taking place in northern Rakhine state

====================

The Special Advisers have been following the situation in northern Rakhine state for several years and have
warned that there was a risk that atrocity crimes could be committed there. Risk factors they identified included
very deeply rooted and long-standing discriminatory practices and policies against the Rohingya Muslims
population, a failure to stop acts of violence against that group and a failure to put in place conditions that
would support the peaceful coexistence of different communities in Rakhine state. “Despite warnings issued by
us and by many other officials, the Government of Myanmar has failed to meet its obligations under
international law and primary responsibility to protect the Rohingya population from atrocity crimes. The
international community has equally failed its responsibilities in this regard”, the Special Advisers stated

====================

The Special Advisers welcomed recommendations presented by United Nations Security Council Members
during an Arria formula meeting on Myanmar on 13 October and urged for an immediate end to the violence in
northern Rakhine state, full humanitarian access and the safe, dignified and voluntary return of refugees to their
homes. In addition, they highlighted the importance of allowing the Human Rights Council independent
international fact-finding mission to access northern Rakhine state to ascertain the veracity of the facts

====================

A recent report by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights describes vicious,
well-organised, coordinated and systematic attacks by Myanmar security forces, often in concert with armed
Rakhine Buddhist individuals against thousands of civilian Rohingya, committed with an intent to drive that
population out of Myanmar and prevent them from returning to their homes. These acts are reported to be in
response to attacks by militants on 25 August 2017 against Myanmar police posts and a regimental
headquarters. United Nations sources indicate that more than 530,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since
then. A few thousand Buddhist and Hindu civilians are also reported to be displaced while fleeing attacks by
militants. “Once again, our failure to stop atrocity crimes makes us complicit. When will we live up to our
countless promises of ‘never again’?” the Special Advisers asked. They emphasized that those implicated in
the commission of atrocity crimes must be held accountable, whatever their status

====================

During the discussions at the Security Council, the Special Advisers were encouraged by what seems to be a
consensus among the membership of the Council and the Government of Myanmar to implement the
recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, headed by Kofi Annan. They acknowledged
as positive the appointment by the Myanmar Government of a ministerial committee to follow up on these
recommendations. However, the Special Advisers noted, “True commitment will come with implementation

====================

Any further delay in implementing the recommendations of the Advisory Commission, including on issues of
citizenship, will mean further violence and destabilization for the region.” They also urged the international
community to support the Myanmar Government in this regard

====================

Finally, the Special Advisors urged the Government of Myanmar to work towards a national identity in which all
populations of Myanmar, including those that identify themselves as Rohingya, feel part of. “Peace and
development in Myanmar will only come with unity and peaceful coexistence of all populations”, the Special
Advisers concluded

====================

Note: the expression “atrocity crimes” is used by the Special Advisers to refer to three crimes under
international law: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes
