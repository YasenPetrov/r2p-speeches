Statement delivered by Morocco — Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2016
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]

Thank you, Sir. The international community has made great headway in terms of protection, be it with
regard to peacekeeping, protection and promotion of human rights, democracy and rule of law and in
terms of atrocities prevention

====================

The notion of Responsibility to Protect for its part has seen significant developments in recent years and
the International Community now acknowledges the fact that states shoulder the primary responsibility
to protect their populations against genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity

====================

However, the international community is still far from having attained the goal it set for itself. The gap
between international commitments in favor of responsibility to protect and the situation on the ground
remains troubling. The constant escalation of conflict and the nefarious humanitarian consequences on
the populations are of concern and it prompts us to build up our initiatives so as to surmount the obstacles
in the way of full implementation by the international community of its responsibility to protect the
world’s citizens

====================

Mr. Special Advisor, the major obstacle that the international community faces is to strike a balance
between the need to protect populations and avoiding unfettered implementation of responsibility to
protect and on the other hand manipulation or political exploitation of these noble goals. In this context,
my delegation would like to recall the intersection between the three pillars of responsibility to protect
while emphasizing the primary responsibility of states to protect their own people. My delegation would
also like to reiterate the importance which must be attached to prevention in upholding the responsibility
to protect. In this regard it is critical to build up support for states so as to enable states to shore up their
national protection mechanisms. This can be done inter alia by honing legal instruments and by shoring
up democracy and primacy of law. Strengthening assistance capacity and technical capacity are the best
preventative tools, this can enable states to create favorable environments for the protection of their own
people

====================

The Human Rights Initiative in this regard is an important instrument of the United Nations for prevention
and detection of situations that are liable to degenerate into conflict or situations that can spawn into
mass human rights violations. The international community must join and support the Secretary-General
in its efforts to promote this initiative. Sir, my delegation takes note with interest of the SecretaryGeneral’s report which delves into the legal, political and moral elements in accountability and
implementation of each of the three pillars of R2P. In this regard, my delegation notes with interest the
range of measures proposed by the report for states to strengthen their accountability and responsibility
in terms of prevention of atrocities. We note the recommendations to reduce the gap between
international commitments and the situation on the ground

====================

By way of conclusion, my delegation would like to reaffirm that upholding R2P can only be done through
strengthened democracy and upholding rule of law and with full respect for human rights and collective
and individual freedoms

====================

Thank you
