SECRETARY GENERAL
ON RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT

THIRD PILLAR:
(REACT & MANNER OF PROMPT AND DECISIVE "

DECLARATION OF
S.E.M Youssoufou Bamba
AMBASSADOR
PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE REPUBLIC OF IVORY COAST WITH THE UNITED NATIONS
NEW YORK

New York, September 5, 2012

Check against delivery The interactive dialogue that brings us together today, chose to focus on the 3 ° "°
pillar of the principle of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), namely, the resolute reaction
timely international community

====================

This choice seems good about, given the events of recent news,
including the situation in Syria and North Mali, to name but two examples,
that reinforce the relevance of the reasons that led the Heads of State and
Governments at the 2005 World Summit, to affirm this principle of
"Responsibility to Protect" (R2P), in accordance with paragraphs 138 and 139 of
Document said top end

====================

From our viewpoint, the R2P had been too long hidden, while the reality
it represents, namely, protect populations against genocide, crimes
war, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, permeates
all conflict situations

====================

Recent developments reflecting some visibility we see this principle
should in our view be to incorporate this principle at regional and international level
in the architecture of collective security systems and mechanisms
preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention, management and resolution of conflicts, peacekeeping
peace and peacebuilding

====================

With specific regard to the case of West Africa, one can cite the example
pioneer of the intervention of the ECOWAS force (ECOMOG) in the first conflict
Liberia in 1990, akin perfectly to the operationalization of the 3rd "pillar
R2P

====================

Indeed, the initiative to send a West African multinational force to restore
the order in Liberia was a reaction to an immediate emergency, to
halt mass atrocities that were being committed. This
presence of ECOWAS has certainly helped facilitate the negotiations in the
United Nations Security Council and the deployment of peacekeepers to Liberia
United Nations

====================

Subsequently, the legal framework for these interventions was organized by the adoption in 1991
the declaration of principles Abuja on fundamental human rights
Citizens of ECOWAS, and in 1999 by the establishment of the Mechanism 10

====================

prevention, management, resolution of conflict, peace and security
in the sub-region

====================

This mechanism of collective security institutionalizes the intervention framework of the
ECOWAS through the establishment of the Force ECOWAS Standby, where ECOWAS Standby
Force (ESF)

====================

The Mechanism was completed in 2001 by the Additional Protocol on Democracy and
Good Governance, and in 2008 by the Conflict Prevention Framework
ECOWAS

====================

It should be recalled that ECOWAS also intervened in Sierra Leone in
1997 in Guinea Bissau in 1998 in Ivory Coast in 2002, is currently deployed in
Guinea Bissau, and expects at this time the authorization of the Security Council for a
deployment in Mali

====================

Regarding the operationalization of 3 "pillar of R2P relatively in case of crisis

Ivory Coast, the reference point is the resolution 1975 (2011)

====================

Indeed, on 30 March 2011, the United Nations Security Council, deeply concerned
by the rise of violence in Côte d'Ivoire due to heavy weapons massive use
by the regime in decline of the former President, decided to make a strong response to
the situation kept deteriorating, through the adoption of resolution 1975 (2011)
which takes into account the following objectives:

strengthening the mandate of PONUCI, with a specific mandate to protect
civilians in danger

====================

the imposition of sanctions against Ivorians who, while refusing to
recognize the election results, incite hatred and violence

====================

banning the use of heavy weapons against civilians;
the intervention of the International Criminal Court in order to track down the perpetrators
of massive human rights in Côte d'Ivoire

====================

6, 7 and 9 April 2011, have seen an unprecedented escalation of the camp attacks
former President, both against civilians, the seat of government
legitimate and the seat of the UNOCI

====================

Faced with these unacceptable actions, including the continued use of heavy weapons to
the civilian population and the peacekeepers and the attack against the headquarters of
legitimate government, the UN Secretary General was forced to avoid
genocide in Ivory Coast, to instruct the Mission, after consultations
Member States and technical services, to take all necessary measures
to prevent the use of such weapons, in accordance with resolutions 1975 (2011) and
1962 (2010) of the Security Council. 15

====================

Thus, April 9, 2011, around 17:00 Abidjan, UNOCI has launched a
military operation to prevent the use of heavy weapons threatening security
civilian population of Abidjan and that of all civilian and military personnel of
UN in Ivory Coast. The French forces Licorne have provided support
necessary to UNOCI, in accordance with paragraph 17 of resolution 1962 (2010)
security Council

====================

On 11 April 2011, the former president was arrested and the democratically elected President
after certification by the United Nations of the results of the presidential election, could therefore
assume the fullness of its prerogatives as President of the Republic of Cote
ivory

====================

The post-election crisis that lasted five months, has caused 3,000 deaths, 1 million
IDPs and 500,000 refugees

====================

In conclusion, I would like to make two points:

First, and considering the fact that cases of implementation of the 3 "pillar
R2P are undoubtedly the consequence of the failure found at the two pillars
earlier, it is important to emphasize at the end of the crisis on education and
R2P awareness at all levels of society and particularly at
armed elements in the context of particular SSR and DDR; significant support from
the international community is necessary in this regard

====================

Second, since it is the regional and subregional organizations
who are the first on the ground when a conflict breaks out, they have a duty to

====================

appropriating the principle of R2P and to implement it in their respective mechanisms

====================

prevention, management and resolution of conflicts and in their security systems
collective. In this regard, the leadership shown by the Arab League in crisis
Libya and the situation in Syria, as the constant commitment of the ECOWAS
all theaters of conflict in West Africa, including those currently underway
Guinea Bissau and Mali, are encouraging in many respects

====================

Finally, I would like to conclude by expressing the same belief that
UN Secretary-General to state that the principle of Responsibility
protect is mature and that the international community must take ownership
to avoid the occurrence of a situation similar to that currently underway in Syria.
