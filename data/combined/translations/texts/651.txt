DECLARATION OF
S.E.M Youssourou Bamba
AMBASSADOR
PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE REPUBLIC OF IVORY COAST WITH THE UNITED NATIONS
New York

New York, September 5, 2012

Check against delivery The interactive dialogue that brings us together today, chose to focus on the 3 °
pillar of the principle of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), namely, the resolute reaction
timely international community

====================

This choice seems to us much about, given the recent events I'actualité,
including the situation in Syria and North Mali, to name but two examples,
that reinforce the relevance of the reasons that led the Heads of State and
Governments at the 2005 World Summit, affirming this principle of
"Responsibility to Protect" (R2P), in accordance with paragraphs 138 and 139 of
Document said top end

====================

From our viewpoint, the R2P had been too long hidden, while the reality
it represents, namely 4, protect populations against genocide, crimes
war, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against | humanity permeates
all conflict situations

====================

Recent developments reflecting some visibility we see this principle
4 should our view aim 4 incorporate that principle at regional and international level
in the architecture of the systems of collective security, and mechanisms of
preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention, management and resolution of conflicts, peacekeeping
peace and peacebuilding

====================

Regarding the case of Africa particulisrement West include Example
pioneer of the intervention of the ECOWAS force (ECOMOG) in the first conflict
Liberia in 1990, akin perfectly to the operationalization of the 3rd pillar of the
R2P

====================

Indeed, the initiative to send a West African multinational force to restore
order in Liberia was a reaction to an immediate emergency, to
put an end to mass atrocities that were going to be committed. This
presence of ECOWAS has certainly helped to facilitate negotiations in the
United Nations Security Council and the deployment of peacekeepers to Liberia
United Nations

====================

Subsequently, the legal framework for these interventions was organized by the adoption in 1991
the declaration of principles Abuja on fundamental human rights
Citizens of ECOWAS, and in 1999 by the establishment of the Mechanism 10

====================

the

====================

prevention, management, settlement of conflicts, peacekeeping and security
in the sub-region

====================

This mechanism of collective security institutionalizes the intervention framework of the
ECOWAS through the establishment of the Force ECOWAS Standby, or ECOWAS Standby
Force (ESF)

====================

The Mechanism was completed in 2001 by the Additional Protocol on Democracy and
Good Governance, and in 2008 by the Conflict Prevention Framework
ECOWAS

====================

It should be recalled that ECOWAS also intervened in Sierra Leone in
1997 in Guinea Bissau in 1998, Cote d'Ivoire in 2002, is deployed in actucllement
Guinea Bissau, and expects at this time [authorization of the Security Council for a
deployment in Mali

====================

Regarding | operationalization of 3 "pillar of R2P relatively in case of crisis

Cête in ivory, the reference point is the resolution 1975 (2011)

====================

Indeed, on 30 March 2011, the United Nations Security Council, deeply concerned
by the rise of violence in Ivory Cête due to heavy weapons massive use
by the regime in decline of the former President, has decided to face a strong response
the situation kept deteriorating, through the adoption of resolution 1975 (2011)
which takes into account the following objectives:

strengthening the mandate of? ONUCTI, with a specific mandate to protect
civilians in danger;

taking sanctions against Ivorians who, while refusing to
recognize the election results, incite to hatred and violence;

Vinterdiction the use of heavy weapons against civilians;
The intervention of the International Criminal Court in order to track down the perpetrators
of massive human rights in Ivory Cête

====================

6, 7 and 9 April 2011, have seen an unprecedented escalation of the camp attacks
Vancien President, 4 both against civilian populations, the Government Sigge
legitimate and the siege of UNOCI

====================

Faced with these unacceptable actions, including I'utilisation continuous heavy weapons to
the civilian population and the peacekeepers and the attack against the headquarters of
legitimate government, the UN Secretary General was forced to avoid
genocide in Cete d'Ivoire, to instruct the Mission 4, after consultations
Member States and technical services, to take all necessary measures
to impede the use 4 weapons, in accordance with resolutions 1975 (2011)
1962 (2010) of the Security Council. 15

====================

====================

====================

====================

Thus, April 9, 2011, around 17:00 Abidjan, UNOCI has launched a
military operation helps us prevent I'utilisation heavy weapons threatening security
civilian population of Abidjan and that of all civilian and military personnel of
UN in Ivory thugs. The French forces Licorne have provided support
has the necessary? ONUCTI accordance with paragraph 17 of resolution 1962 (2010)
security Council

====================

April 11, 2011, former President was screeching halt and the democratically elected President
after certification by? UN results of presidential I'élection, could die at
assume the fullness of all its prerogatives of the President of the Republic of thugs
ivory

====================

The post-election crisis that lasted months cing, caused 3,000 deaths, 1 million
IDPs and 500,000 refugees

====================

In conclusion, I would like to make two points:

First, side view of the fact that cases of setting ceuvre of 3 "pillar
R2P are undoubtedly the result of | failure found at the two pillars
earlier, it is important to emphasize at the end of crises and I'éducation
Awareness has R2P has all levels of society and at the particuligrement
armed elements in the context of particular SSR and DDR; significant support from
the international community is necessary in this regard;

Second, since it is the regional and subregional organizations
who are the first on the ground when a conflict breaks out, they have a duty to
appropriating the principle of R2P and the conerétiser in their respective mechanisms

====================

prevention, management and resolution of conflicts and in their systems of safety
collective. In this regard, the leadership shown by the Arab League in crisis
Libya and the situation in Syria, as | 'constant commitment of ECOWAS
all theaters of conflict in West Africa, including those currently underway
Guinea Bissau and Mali, are encouraging more ways than one

====================

Finally, I would like to conclude by expressing the conviction that the same
UN Secretary-General to state that the principle of Responsibility
protection arrived at maturity and that the international community must take ownership
to avoid the occurrence of a situation similar to that currently underway in Syria.
