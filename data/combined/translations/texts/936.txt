Georgia aligns itself
with the statement delivered by the Permanent Observer
of the European Union yesterday (see A/73/PV.93). I
wish to make a few remarks in my national capacity

====================

My delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General
for his report (A/73/898) entitled “Responsibility to
protect: lessons learned for prevention”, and welcomes
the appointment of Ms. Karen Smith as the Special
Adviser of Secretary-General on the Responsibility to
Protect (R2P)

====================

Georgia has been continuously supporting the
principle of the responsibility to protect and welcomes
the opportunity for a formal debate on this important
item at the General Assembly once again this year. As
the world continues to witness conflicts, the abuse of
human rights, ethnic cleansing and forced displacement
in almost every corner of the world, it is high time for
all of us to reinvigorate our common endeavour against

those challenges across all three pillars of the notion
of R2P

====================

The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is
for good men to do nothing. For that very reason, the
Secretary-General in his report calls for more efforts
by all of us,
“to translate early warning of atrocity crimes
into decisive early action towards prevention”

====================

(A/73/898, para. 31)
Georgia — a country with its own bitter
experience — suffered several waves of ethnic
cleansing owing to the foreign military occupation, and
is no stranger to having undergone the toll of forced
displacement for more than two decades so far. Against
that background, we fully understand the importance
of strong and proactive preventive tools to avert the
outbreak and protraction of crises, which target civilians
most of all. Georgia is committed to advance its relevant
national mechanisms, be it through the ratification of
the core instruments of international human rights and
humanitarian law or putting in place national human
rights institutions to address atrocity prevention

====================

Essentially, the criminal code of Georgia entails a
separate section on offences against humankind, which
includes responsibility for crimes against humanity,
peace and security, and international humanitarian law

====================

We also make our contribution under pillar II of R2P
by sharing our experience in building corruption-free,
effective, accountable and transparent institutions, as
envisaged by Sustainable Development Goal 16, and
strengthening the principles of open governance

====================

The report of the Secretary-General rightly notes,
“There is a growing gap between [our] words of
commitment and the experience of protecting
vulnerable populations around the world”. (ibid.,
para. 7)
In that context, let me recall the dire situation of people
living on the other side of the occupation line in the
two Georgian regions of Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali/
South Ossetia region. Despite numerous calls from the
international community, including the latest Human
Rights Council resolution on Georgia, both occupied
regions remain closed to international human rights
bodies, including the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights. Sadly, the
people on the ground face grave violations of freedom
of movement, restrictions on education in their native

language, the deprivation of property rights and unlawful
detentions, among many more. This situation creates
an acute risk that could potentially lead to atrocity
crimes and therefore requires greater international
attention. The responsibility of Member States to assist
is of paramount importance in this regard, especially
when we address cases in which a sovereign State is
prevented from exercising its responsibility owing to
foreign military occupation

====================

It is imperative that the Security Council be able
to act in a timely and efficient manner, exercising its
critical role in the prevention of mass atrocities. In this
context, we reiterate our full support for the FrenchMexican initiative on voluntary veto-right restriction
to prevent such crimes and for the Accountability,
Coherence and Transparency group code of conduct

====================

This year, as we mark the seventieth anniversary of
the adoption of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the time
is ripe to reflect on the challenges facing us, take stock
of the achievements made and unite in action to uphold
the notion of “never again”

====================

Finally, let me reiterate Georgia’s commitment to
advancing the goals and objectives of the responsibility
to protect and to support the Secretary-General in his
endeavour to integrate atrocity prevention into the
United Nations prevention platform.
