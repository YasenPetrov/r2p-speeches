Informal Interactive Dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect
UN the general meeting 7

Statement by Mr. Adama Dieng
Special Adviser to the Secretary-General for the Prevention of Genocide

New York, September 6, 2016

Mister President,

Mr. Deputy Secretary-General,
Excellencies and delegates,

Ladies and gentlemen,

Introduction

If, in the early twenty-first century, no country can impose its lasting dictatorship by
weapons on its civilian population, it is also clear that no country, whatever its
power, can not, in itself, come to the aid of those in distress, 4 less
lead a liberation war by proxy. Those days seem gone. But it |
however, that is still the death toll in suffering, in misery for
civilians remains unbearable

====================

Rest multilateral diplomacy United Nations

====================

She has the right instrument to achieve this?

Yes, but it is not yet finished and shared: This is the "Responsibility to Protect"
(R2P) "peaceful weapon," including the United Nations equip themselves, 6O years after their creation,
when Ja nature of armed conflict has changed from inter-state confrontations
4 internal rifts

====================

My contribution to the debate today is simple, which is 4 remind your
Remember some of the main points of the 2016 report on the responsibility of
protect the particular aim of food for thought, is undoubtedly rich, who
will follow in the informal interactive dialogue

====================

As you know, this year's report is based on the findings of the report
Previous and aims to assess the progress on the principle of responsibility
protect, ten years after its adoption at the 2005 World Summit

====================

This year, the Secretary-General invites us 4 even further reflection on
various obstacles to greater mobilization of collective action to
prevent and respond to genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against I'humanité. Our duty today is therefore in the context of
find effective ways to overcome these obstacles. :

A more difficult situation

The report establishes a link between I'augmentation the frequency and magnitude of
criminal atrocities and decreased respect for international humanitarian law. A
parallel is established between the increase in criminal atrocities and other
Key issues on the international agenda including the global crisis
forced displacement

====================

In the current difficult environment, it is more important than ever to protect
populations. The report calls the unit has not only face situations ot a
Quick and decisive action is required, but also - and especially - the beginnings of a dice
crisis

====================

In the view of the Secretary-General, political divisions prevent decisive action. By
Therefore, the search unit is an essential element for Implementation of
the responsibility to protect

====================

It is our duty to reflect and realize our political commitments

There is no doubt that other factors influence for Implementation of
responsibility to protect, which also were raised during the seven dialogues
interactive prior to the General Assembly on the Responsibility to Protect

====================

First, some Member States still questioning the relationship between the three
pillars, wondering if they should operate sequential manner within
for Implementation of the responsibility to protect. The report emphasizes that the pillars
not congus to operate sequential manner, but said that the use
some preventive tools or reagents must follow a sequential logic. By
Therefore, the use of military force should be the last resort

====================

Second, Member States requested clarification regarding
Basic components for industrial action in response
situations ot the States obviously can not protect their populations
against criminal atrocities. The report puts forward several proposals
focus on strengthening early warning mechanisms to ensure that 4
credible information provided by impartial actors, can reach the appropriate decision-making bodies within the United Nations and
elsewhere

====================

It is clear that the conceptual issues should not impede the setting 4
ceuvre of the responsibility to protect, given the number of situations in the world
ot populations at high risk of crimes and atrocities. We have
not that luxury. We must continue to take collective action to respond to
political commitment adopted by member states in 2005, and when it will ot
necessary

====================

However, we must not ignore the conceptual issues. The dialogues
periodicals, such as the one we are having today, contribute to reducing manner
considerable differences and 4 put on the table the challenges and opportunities
surround for Implementation of the principle of protection. I think it would be desirable to
find other opportunities to discuss these dialogues, both formal way or
informal

====================

Obstacles 4 implementation

The report refers to three types of developments that threaten to widen
the gap between the commitments of Member States and the reality which people
vulnerable face. First, we are witnessing an alarming 4 unprincipled
fundamentals of international law. Deuxigmement, Member States have not
sufficiently translated their commitments regarding crime prevention
atrocity since concrete prevention strategies do not exist in some
frames. Troisitmement, we note with concern the increasing Rele actors
External that amplify the commission of criminal atrocities

====================

A vision for collective action

To enforce the commitment of States policy to take action
collective, the Secretary-General encourages the implementation of existing measures
four fronts

====================

First, it is necessary to continue 4 develop and coordinate strategies
4 preventive manner make them more effective. Although it has been said several
times, we still need to improve efforts to collect and
analyze relevant information. Much effort has been devoted
improving technical elements relating to the collection of information. Nevertheless, we must strengthen our capacity to share sensitive information that could
lead to effective preventive action

====================

Furthermore, effective prevention may require changing some practices
job. We must adopt adequate measures to ensure that 4 threads
on specific situations of concern focus more on
The identification of strategic options to address risks. It could
encourage rapid action to protect populations

====================

The development of effective prevention strategies also requires the identification of
areas of complementarity with other key programs of action, including
prevention of violent extremism. When we look at the conditions in the
spread of violent extremism, we examine several of the risk factors
criminal atrocities

====================

Second, we simply need to be prepared to provide a response
Quick and decisive. Each member of the international community that
responsibility, which can lead to different responses, 4 levels, it
either bilaterally or through the frame 4 regional organizations
International. This goes along with the need to increase investment in
wide range of tools peaceful 4 us. On this front, it is necessary
1a to increase coordination with regional actors and civil society to
promote an appropriate response

====================

At the Security Council, the report calls for Council members to
leadership by accepting a certain restraint in the use of the veto
in situations involving heinous crimes

====================

Thirdly, we all know about the close link between prevention and recurrence

====================

As the Deputy Secretary-General us | has reminded, too many countries that are
4 now face a risk of generalized violence and systematic | 'lived
before. The report encourages the provision of targeted support to national authorities
located in such recurrence of situations, including 4 through
investments in transitional justice initiatives. I have in mind the process
reconciliation

====================

Finally, he encouraged a renewed institutional capacity to
overcome all these obstacles. At the UN, we are committed to redouble 4
our efforts to integrate the responsibility to protect any situation that requires its
consideration. We are also committed to persevere in our efforts to revitalize and processing to make the organization fit to meet the challenges of
protection. At the national and regional levels, the report recognizes the importance of
global and regional networks and the national capacity building dedicated form
focal points for Tesponsabilité protect

====================

The report contains a list of steps Suggestive to strengthen the capacity of
regional organizations to work with the UN and with other actors on
means prevention and response to criminal atrocities

Conclusion

The report concludes with a call to each member of the international community
Tenouveler commitment was the tool of responsibility to protect. This requires that we
dénoricions genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against I'humanité when committed or about to be committed. this requires
also that we give priority to the protection of vulnerable populations au
beyond the political -_étroits _intéréts when many same legitimate

====================

We must also redouble our efforts to overcome political divisions. It is
vital to invest in strengthening concrete prevention and response capabilities
quick. Finally, we must follow Vappel the Secretary-General for strengthening the
political leadership to make the responsibility to protect a living reality. I
sincerely think that all the points mentioned in this speech are dependent
of the latter,

Thank you.
