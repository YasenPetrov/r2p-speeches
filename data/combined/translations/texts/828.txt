(spoke in French):
Switzerland associates itself with the statement
delivered this morning by the representative of Denmark
on behalf of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility
to Protect (see A/73/PV.93)

====================

Switzerland welcomes the inclusion of this
important debate on the agenda of the seventy-third
session of the General Assembly. As a country that
has made the prevention of atrocity crimes one of its
foreign policy objectives, we commend the SecretaryGeneral for having focused his report (A/73/898) on the
lessons learned in the area of prevention. Switzerland
agrees with the report’s main points and would like to
stress three in particular

====================

First, we can never emphasize enough how crucial
it is for us to manage diversity constructively. Although
our own system in Switzerland is by no means perfect,
it is precisely the efforts we have made in this area,
especially with regard to our linguistic minorities, that
have enabled us to live in peace for more than 150 years
and to feel that we are all equal citizens. This transcends
our cultural differences, which we consider a source of
richness rather than an obstacle. We are always happy to
share our experiences, be it with regard to federalism,
decentralization or respect for linguistic minorities

====================

Secondly, for the past 15 years, Switzerland has
been lending support to processes of addressing the
past in various contexts. That experience has shown
us the importance of putting in place guarantees of
non-recurrence in order to break cycles of violence
and establish lasting peace. Those guarantees — a less
well-known and less-analysed pillar of transitional
justice that is sometimes reduced only to security sector
reforms — are precisely what make it possible to best
address and eliminate the root causes of violence. They
also form a natural link between peace and security,
human rights and development

====================

Thirdly, Switzerland wholeheartedly supports the
approach proposed by the Secretary-General, which
aims to ensure that a more holistic type of prevention
be launched early on. It is for that same reason that
we are committed to Global Action Against Mass
Atrocity Crimes, whose efforts in that regard focus on
the responsibility to protect at the national level and
on learning between countries and communities. We
remain convinced that, when it comes to the prevention
of conflicts and atrocities, we have much to learn from
other prevention systems, such as from public health
systems and from efforts to prevent natural disasters

====================

In those areas, it has been possible to adopt a more
holistic approach and make advances in genuine early
prevention. The review of Sustainable Development
Goal 16 during the High-level Political Forum next
month will also offer an opportunity to place prevention
at the centre of our debate and action

====================

The fight against impunity also has an essential
role to play in prevention, in particular through its
deterrent effect. It is important to close all loopholes
and ensure that those responsible for crimes of
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes be
brought to justice. National justice systems have the
primary responsibility to prosecute and judge those
crimes. If that is not possible, however, international
criminal justice must play a complementary and critical
role. Switzerland therefore continues to promote and
support international mechanisms to combat impunity,
particularly the International Criminal Court

====================

Finally, we would like to take this opportunity to
thank the Office on Genocide Prevention and the Office
on the Responsibility to Protect and its Special Advisers
for their efforts to keep the prevention of atrocities on
the Organization’s agenda.
