Mr. President,
I welcome this debate at the General Assembly of the United Nations to discuss the
report of the Secretary General on the implementation of the responsibility to protect and
I align myself with the statement made by the Representative of Sweden on behalf of the
European Union

====================

The concept of the responsibility to protect has been endorsed by our leaders at the
highest level. At the World Summit in 2005, the General Assembly indeed unanimously
adopted the Outcome Document of which paragraphs 138 and 139 form the basis of the
responsibility to protect. The entire international community has taken a solemn
commitment by underlining the obligation of State to protect its citizens from genocide,
war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. Our Heads of State and
Government have recognized that it is fundamental to avoid the avoidable, that is, the
repetition of the failures of the international community in the face of the atrocities
committed in Rwanda, in ex-Yugoslavia and in Cambodia

====================

This first report on implementing the responsibility to protect is a major step towards a
concrete strategy translating the concept into reality

====================

Mr. President,
All Member States of the UN have recognized in 2005 that the responsibility to protect
does neither weaken the principle of State sovereignty, which is at the core of
international relations in the 21" century, nor justify arbitrary interventionism. As the
Secretary General recalls in his report, the responsibility to protect is an ally of
sovereignty, not an adversary. Sovereignty entails rights but also responsibilities, and
among the latter, none is as important as the responsibility to protect one's citizens. The
scope of this responsibility is limited to four types of particularly heinous crimes, namely
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity

====================

Paragraphs 138 and 139 further stipulate that the international community shall assist
States to meet their obligations under the responsibility to protect, by encouraging them
to effectively carry out their responsibilities or by assisting them to reinforce their
national capacities to prevent crimes. Preventive action is indeed the key component of
the responsibility to protect, as it seeks to save lives. The establishment of an early
warning capacity, as the report suggests, could as a matter of fact contribute to preventing
potential tragedies. My country is convinced that investing into training programmes on
human rights, mediation, conflict prevention, crisis management and good governance
will be beneficial in the long term. Many international actors can also play a crucial role
in terms of prevention, in particular regional organizations - and I'll mention only
ECOWAS, which has an early warning mechanism -, the Human Rights Council through
its universal periodic review, the Peacebuilding Commission, the members of fact finding
missions, humanitarian actors, peacekeepers, but also the Secretary General himself. It is
however first and foremost up to Members States to work towards the prevention of
conflicts

====================

Finally, the responsibility to protect can also translate into collective action by the
international community, through the United Nations, on a case by case basis, to protect
populations against crimes and violations when States manifestly fail to meet their
protection obligations. In fast-evolving situations, it is indeed vital that we are able to
react quickly to save human lives

====================

Mr. President,
Their might be differences of views on the responsibility to protect but there is a strong
consensus among all Member States to honor the principle of the "Never Again". The
concept is laid out, it is now time to focus on its implementation. We all have to show the
necessary political will to take this implementation forward at the United Nations and to
deepen the concept on the basis of further contributions from the Secretary General

====================

Mr. President,
The memory of the millions of victims of past atrocities is a constant reminder that we
have a burning obligation to pursue our dialogue in this forum to implement the
responsibility to protect
