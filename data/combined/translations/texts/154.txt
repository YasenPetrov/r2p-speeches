STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR BURHAN GAFOOR
PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF SINGAPORE
TO THE UNITED NATIONS,

AT THE INFORMAL INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE
ON THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT,

6 SEPTEMBER 2016

 

Mr President,

We would like to thank you for convening this informal interactive
dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect. As we are witnessing an increase in the

frequency and scale of atrocity crimes, the dialogue today is timely

====================

We would like to thank the Secretary-General for keeping R2P high on the
UN agenda. His latest report provides a rich set of recommendations on how we can
take this agenda forward. I would like to highlight some key actions that we can take
in line with the three pillars of the Responsibility to Protect to make a practical

difference on the ground

====================

First, the primary responsibility for the protection of populations from
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity rests with the
State. National governments cannot abdicate their responsibility to protect their
citizens. Instability and extremism flourish when the needs and aspirations of citizens

are not met. Human development is key. Last year, Leaders agreed on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. The onus is on each of us to implement these goals and targets,
particularly, in this context, SDG 16, on the promotion of peaceful and inclusive
societies for sustainable development. While the Agenda is universal, each society
and country will have to decide for itself the best policies for its particular
context. There can be no one-size-fits-all approach. Singapore is committed to
achieving the 2030 Agenda and to continuing to building an inclusive and harmonious

society, regardless of race and religion

====================

Second, Member States agreed at the 2005 World Summit to support each
other in their national efforts to improve resilience, forming pillar 3 of
R2P. Partnerships are key. The UN, regional organisations and civil society must
work with each other to support the 2030 Agenda and create in each of our countries
the necessary institutions and capacities for a resilient and inclusive society. We
should heed the old adage that ‘prevention is better than cure’. The priority must be
to help countries ensure that the conditions for instability and conflict never arise. But
if they do arise, there is a case for the international community to act in a spirit of

solidarity

====================

Which leads to my third point. The international community has an
obligation - under pillar 3- to help address situations where crimes of atrocity have
occurred, in a timely and decisive manner. But to do so, the international community
must act through the UN, as was made clear in para 139 of the World Summit

Outcome

====================

Small states such as Singapore look to the Security Council to live up to its
global responsibility to maintain international peace and security. Unfortunately, we

have seen the veto used too often in the past to prevent action to address crimes of

2 atrocity, at the cost of too many innocent lives. We are therefore pleased that two P5
members, notably the UK and France, have supported initiatives aimed at limiting the
use of the veto in cases of mass atrocities. We agree that blocking action at the
Council in such cases is not a right and have similarly supported these initiatives as
well. We therefore call on other permanent members of the Security Council to
unambiguously and unilaterally state that they will refrain from using the veto to
block Council action aimed at preventing or ending genocide, war crimes, and crimes
against humanity. Such a commitment will help to signal the resolve of the Security
Council to play its part to support the R2P agenda and to work “to leave no one
behind”

====================

J thank you.
