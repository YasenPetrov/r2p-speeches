Mr. Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide,
I would like to thank the President of the General Assembly for having
convened this interactive dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect (RtoP),
and the Secretary General for his Report. Also, I would like to recognize your
constant cooperation and welcome Mrs. Jennifer Walsh

====================

Mr. Moderator,
As the Permanent Representative of Argentina intervened as a panelist this
morning, this statement will briefly touch upon some complementary aspects

====================

The Final Outcome of the 2005 Summit embodies a commitment that
constitutes no new norm, but is a political concept summarizing all
international obligations of States under international human rights law,
international humanitarian law and refugee law. Since the beginning,
Argentina supports the concept of RtoP

====================

Mr. Moderator,
Ambassador Perceval, at the panel, made reference to the reaffirmation of the
primary responsibility of the State that took place in Argentina due to the
serious violations of human rights committed during the military dictatorship
between 1976-83 and to the national measures adopted to investigate,
prosecute and punish those responsible, and to maintain memory of those
events, something necessary to ensure non recurrence. Those measures were
complemented with actions in the international arena, to which she referred

====================

I would then like to touch upon the following aspects:
The Latin-American Network for the Prevention of Genocide and Mass
Atrocities was launched in 2012 with the cooperation of the Auschwitz
Institute and with the support of the Office of the Special Advisor for the
Prevention of Genocide. The Network is already functioning, with the
collaboration of 18 Latin-American countries

====================

Also, the Regional Fora for the Prevention of Genocide are an undertaking
initiated in 2008 together with Switzerland and Tanzania. Recently, Cambodia
joined this initiative

====================

The Global Action against Mass Atrocity Crimes has been mentioned by
other countries. The Global Action was launched this year under the auspices
5

of Tanzania and Switzerland, and Argentina participated together with
Australia, Costa Rica and Denmark, as well as the Joint Office for the
Prevention of Genocide and RtoP and NGOs. The purpose is to have a
network of international cooperation under which existing networks on the
prevention of genocide and RtoP could channel cooperation on prevention

====================

Mr. Moderator,
A crucial element of prevention is the acceptance by States of the obligations
arising from instruments on the protection of human rights, on humanitarian
law and on refugee law. Also, I would like to underscore the importance of
ratifying the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court, as the
contribution of the ICC to the fight against impunity is undeniable

====================

Argentina coincides in the challenge it is to incorporate prevention of
atrocities into national human rights policies, but at the same time it is
important to achieve more integration at the UN with, for example, other
parts of the Secretariat, the Human Rights Council and the rapporteurs and
independent experts mechanisms, human rights treaties organs and factfinding commissions

====================

Mr. Moderator,
We believe it is important now to remember that since the inception of the
RtoP concept, coercive measures –in particular the use of force- were those
that, even when conceived as ultima ratio, generated discomfort and distrust

====================

That distrust was increased by the armed action authorized by the Security
Council with respect to Libya, and the Secretary General himself recognized
the concerns raised in his 2012 Report

====================

Action by the United Nations cannot either pursue political objectives alien to
the Organization, or cause more victims among the civilians seeking to
protect, as it would affect the credibility of the RtoP concept and, in the end,
the legitimacy of collective action by the UN

====================

Today, several delegations made reference to the situation in Syria, and we
heard some interventions calling for armed action

====================

Argentina condemns the use of chemical weapons as firmly at it condemns all
other serious violations of human rights, occurring anywhere in the world,
under any excuse, and whomever is responsible, and firmly believes in the
6

need to hold those responsible to account. Argentina supports the
investigation by the Secretary General on the possible use of chemical
weapons in Syria, and awaits its objective and impartial results

====================

Argentina, since it joined the Security Council and having found a crisis that
had endured for two years, has always sustained the need to achieve a political
solution. Aerial attacks would only cause, as in Libya, more deaths. Also, an
armed action without Security Council authorization would be, simply, a
violation of the UN Charter

====================

Mr. Moderator,
Argentina believes that the way to avoid Pillar III –which raised the concern
of many countries- is to strengthen our efforts and cooperation on
prevention. We support the recommendations of the Report of the Secretary
General, in particular his proposal to address Pillar II next

====================

Finally, I would like to thank once more the Joint Office for its cooperative
work with Member States
