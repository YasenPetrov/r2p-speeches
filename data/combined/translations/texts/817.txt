Like many other delegations,
we welcome the inclusion of today’s debate on the
responsibility to protect (R2P) into the formal agenda
of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session

====================

Poland co-sponsored resolution 63/308, the first standalone General Assembly resolution on R2P in 2009. We
declare our unwavering readiness to support the full
implementation of the concept of the responsibility
to protect

====================

We also wish to warmly welcome the appointment
of Ms. Karen Smith as the new Special Adviser of the
Secretary-General on the Responsibility to Protect

====================

Poland commends efforts undertaken in this crucial
role and supports all actions aimed at mainstreaming
the responsibility to protect within the United Nations
system. We also would like to express our deep
appreciation for the positive role played by the Office
of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the
Prevention of Genocide in advancing the responsibility
to protect, under the leadership of Under-SecretaryGeneral Adama Dieng

====================

The latest report of the Secretary-General
(A/73/898), entitled “Responsibility to protect: lessons
learned for prevention”, reminds us that in 2005 World
Summit outcome document, acknowledged by all
our political leaders, is as valid now as it was then

====================

Let me reiterate that the responsibility to protect is
not an abstract concept. The responsibility to protect
means nothing less than saving lives on ground. Let
me focus on three issues that we believe are of crucial
importance in the context of today’s discussion, namely,
respect for international law, conflict prevention
and accountability

====================

First, with regard to international law, we call
on all Member States to uphold their obligations
under international law, including human rights
law, humanitarian law and refugee law. Respect for
international law instruments can be a true preventive
factor with respect to mass atrocities. Poland addressed
this issue last year during our open debate in the
Security Council (see S/PV.8262) with the aim of
promoting respect for basic rules of international law

====================

Let me reiterate that respect for international law is
not a matter of choice; it is a matter of Member States’
complying with their obligations. Last year, we marked
the seventieth anniversary of the Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide

====================

We urge those Member States that have not yet ratified
the document to do so

====================

Secondly, with regard to conflict prevention, we
believe it is vital that the Security Council better utilize
its working methods in order to bring potential mass
atrocity situations into the spotlight. Poland organized
an Arria Formula meeting last December on raising the
effectiveness of atrocity crimes prevention. Examples
of tangible actions the Security Council could take
to prevent atrocity crimes were abundant in the
meeting. We welcomed the information that eight out
of 14 United Nations peacekeeping operations include
protection of civilians mandates and the fact that the
Council has directly referenced R2P in a number of

mandates, namely, in connection with the Central
African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Mali and South Sudan

====================

Utilizing the right combination of carefully tailored
measures reduces the need for further ones. Preventive
action should be focused and region- and contextspecific. Measures are most effective when they
are individualized and focus on addressing specific
problems or influencing specific individuals. There is
no one-size-fits-all approach. The early recognition of
warning signs must, however, be followed by concrete
actions to prevent the development of conflict. As such,
national and local ownership are critical, and early
action is successful only if it enjoys the support of its
intended beneficiaries. We support community-level
engagement and see a need to further integrated it into
our actions

====================

Thirdly, with regard to accountability, we must not
allow those who commit atrocities to go unpunished

====================

Ensuring accountability for mass atrocity of crimes
is one of the best ways to prevent their recurrence. It
is Member States’ responsibility to investigate and
prosecute crimes committed within their jurisdictions

====================

In the long term, there is no peace without justice and
without accountability. In that context, let me reaffirm
Poland’s support for the International Criminal Court,
which remains the key institutional instrument in the
battle to end impunity for genocide, war crimes and
crimes against humanity

====================

The Security Council, the General Assembly
and the Human Rights Council should consider ways
to better utilize tools at their disposal to strengthen
international accountability for atrocity crimes. Poland,
if elected this year to the Human Rights Council, will
encourage Member States to strengthen the links
between the Human Rights Council and the Security
Council for early action and early warning

====================

In conclusion, we have to renew the commitment of
our leaders, made in 2005, to helping States build their
capacities to protect their populations from genocide,
war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity, and to assisting those that are under stress
before crises and conflicts arise.
