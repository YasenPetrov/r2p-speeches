Statement delivered by the Delegation of Spain to the United Nations, at the United
Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion "From commitment to
implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened by the President
of the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
25 February 2016
Spain aligns itself with the statements by the European Union and by the Group of Friends on
Responsibility to Protect

====================

We wish to take this opportunity for the adoption of the first substantive resolution on
Responsibility to Protect by the General Assembly. In recent years, we have made obvious
progress in developing the concept. What is a priority now, should be to strengthen consensus
around the practical implementation of the system. To this end, we are convinced that it is
essential to have a dialogue in the General Assembly first, and thus we support the inclusion
of Responsibility to Protect on the agenda of the Assembly, but also in the Security Council

====================

When populations are the victims of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic
cleansing there is a risk which threatens international peace and security. Therefore, Spain
organized, together with Chile, the first debate of the Council on Responsibility to Protect and
we will continue to work along these lines. We are aware of the enormous importance of
prevention but also of the responsibility to act on a timely and decisive basis whenever
necessary

====================

This is also part, let us not forget, of the commitment undertaken in 2005. There is no excuse
not to put an end to these crimes of atrocity. There is no excuse for the inaction of the Security
Council given the incapacity of its members to reach agreement. Thus, we support the initiative
of France and Mexico on veto restraint and particularly the Code of Conduct of the ACT group

====================

We urge all States to subscribe to it

====================

In the sad scenario, which we can see in many conflicts today, with violation of the most basic
tenants of international humanitarian law and the norms of human rights, we must recall that
the fight against impunity is essential to prevent atrocity crimes and their recurrence. We wish
to stress the central role of the ICC
