My delegation is
obliged to take the floor to respond to the statement
by the representative of India during the 100th plenary
meeting of the Assembly, on 25 June, which was
nothing but a concocted mix of delusion and falsehood

====================

Contrary to India’s claim, Jammu and Kashmir never
were or will be part of India. According to Security
Council resolutions, they are a disputed territory. The
legal standing is firm and abiding. However much as
India may attempt, that fact can neither be sidestepped
nor wished away

====================

With regard to the human rights situation in
occupied Kashmir, I will venture no further than
the recent report by the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights, which
documents systematic violations of human rights in the
occupied territory. As the report notes, the situation is
exacerbated by parallel judicial structures, built with

the express purpose of “imped[ing] accountability and
jeopardiz[ing] the right to remedy for the victims of
human rights violations”

====================

As much as some may consider it so, repeating
groundless accusations and fabrications does not
lend them credibility. They may at best satisfy a selfdeluding notion of reality, but a farce can go only so far

====================

That is all too apparent from the report of the Office of
the High Commissioner for Human Rights

====================

Regrettably, we have
to request the floor again to respond to the statement
just made by the representative of India. We will not
lend credence to his statement by responding to it. We
will simply say that no amount of obfuscation by India
can alter the incontrovertible reality of the grim human
rights situation in Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir
or the illegality of that occupation.
