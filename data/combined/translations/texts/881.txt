At the outset, I would
like to thank the President of the General Assembly
and the Secretary-General for their statements and
for the advocacy on the responsibility to protect that
the Secretary-General continues to provide, including
through his annual reports. I would also like to
congratulate Australia and Ghana for having made
today’s formal debate possible

====================

Italy aligns itself with the statements delivered
by the observer of the European Union and by the
representative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of
Friends of the Responsibility to Protect (see A/72/
PV.99), which we have the honour of co-chairing this
year, together with Qatar. I would like to make a few
additional remarks in my national capacity

====================

We emphasize that the most effective way to protect
is through prevention. In this regard, we underscore the
importance of understanding that sustainable peace is a
lasting objective, focused on human beings and on the
institutions and processes required to prevent or resolve
violent conflicts

====================

The growing number of attacks on civilians, schools,
hospitals, humanitarian workers and peacekeepers; the
forced displacement of millions of people and today’s
unprecedented refugee crisis; and the widespread and
systematic use of sexual and gender-based violence
as a deliberate strategy by State and non-State actors
are stark reminders of the fact that we need to close
the gap between our commitment to the principle of
the responsibility to protect and our actions. Mass
atrocities can and must be prevented. In 2005, we made
a commitment: early-warning mechanisms exist, and it
is now time for action

====================

Here we also want to highlight the SecretaryGeneral’s report, which focuses on how to improve

The responsibility to protect lies primarily with
national authorities and should therefore start at home

and inform our policy decisions at both the national
and international levels. In this regard, I would like to
highlight three concrete examples of Italy’s endeavours

====================

First, as a non-permanent member of the Security
Council in 2017, Italy spared no effort in pursuing the
core objective of the Council and, ultimately, of the
United Nations, that is, the protection of civilians. We
promoted a more systematic handling of cross-cutting
issues and transnational threats on the part of the
Security Council in the light of their repercussions for
international peace. We highlighted the importance of
implementing a holistic approach that combines security,
development and the protection of human rights

====================

In this regard, I would like to recall the briefings
on the issues of refugees and the threats to the stability
of the Mediterranean posed by terrorism, organized
crime, migration and human trafficking; the adoption
of resolution 2347 (2017), on the impact on international
peace and security of the destruction of cultural heritage
as a way of destroying national identities; the adoption
of resolution 2388 (2017), on trafficking, with its
victim-centred approach; and the adoption of resolution
2382 (2017), aimed at strengthening the role of United
Nations police in protecting civilians, including by
providing assistance and support to local authorities

====================

We encourage the members of the Security Council
to continue to hold regular debates on the threat of
atrocity crimes so as to strengthen the Council’s role
in prevention, including through briefings by the
Secretary-General’s Special Advisers on the Prevention
of Genocide and on the Responsibility to Protect, the
High Commissioner for Human Rights and civilsociety representatives

====================

Secondly, in January we launched the
Responsibility to Protect in Schools project, which
we developed together with the Netherlands as a
concrete way of delivering on our mandate in the
Security Council and in order to raise awareness of
the importance of protecting fundamental rights and
freedoms and establishing international principles for
the prevention of mass atrocities. In this role-playing
game, students are faced with a fictitious but realistic
scenario in which the civilian population is exposed
to mass atrocities and crimes. Through the game, they
also become aware of the complex dynamics that occur
in real life, such as a Government that systematically
violates the rights of part of its population; the inability
of the United Nations to intervene because it has not

been authorized to do so by the Security Council; the
specific interests of some countries; and the crucial
role played by civil society and the media in raising
awareness of the tragic situation through the news,
detailed reporting and, above all, images. We will
promote the project in additional Italian schools and
start collaborating with other Governments to replicate
the course internationally

====================

Thirdly, Italy, as the Western country contributing
the most troops to peacekeeping operations,
immediately endorsed the Kigali Principles on the
Protection of Civilians. We invite other member States
to do the same. We believe that the effective protection
of civilians requires properly trained troops, adequate
equipment and a strong political commitment. Italy
will continue to do its part, redoubling its efforts in
providing training and offering capacity-building
to military, police and judicial officers from all over
the world

====================

Since 2005, through the Centre of Excellence for
Stability Police Units in Vicenza, we have trained more
than 10,000 police personnel units, many of which are
deployed in peacekeeping operations in Africa. Our
personnel are regularly trained in the areas of human
rights, sexual and gender-based violence, the protection
of children in armed conflict and the responsibility to
protect. Last year we joined the Circle of Leadership on
preventing and responding to sexual exploitation and
abuse, launched by the Secretary-General, to heighten
the commitment to preventing and prosecuting cases
of sexual exploitation and abuse, including among our
military personnel

====================

Against that backdrop, we truly believe that with the
simple measures that are available, we can effectively
implement the responsibility to protect. There is no
excuse. In this regard, we believe that there is added
value in including that responsibility as a standing
item on the agenda of the General Assembly so as to
allow the United Nations membership to properly and
formally debate the issue, share best practices and
discuss our differing opinions on the subject.
