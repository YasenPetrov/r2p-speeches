My delegation would
like to thank the President of the General Assembly
for convening this meeting. We hope that todayâ€™s
discussion will foster consensus among Member States
on this important topic

====================

Kazakhstan reaffirms its commitments to
paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit

Outcome document and, as a non-permanent member
of the Security Council, considers it a moral imperative
to protect populations from genocide, war crimes,
ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. In
our commitment to that objective, we have therefore
joined the code of conduct regarding Security Council
action against genocide, crimes against humanity and
war crimes

====================

We support the concept of the responsibility to
protect and its three reinforcing pillars. At the same
time, opinions still differ about the concept of the
responsibility to protect, with contradictory perceptions
of the right to sovereignty and territorial integrity versus
the use of force. We must therefore reflect the concerns
of all Member States, define accurate criteria with
respect to the application of the pillars and principles
of the responsibility to protect and create impartial,
balanced, objective and depoliticized decision-making
mechanisms. We should also review and analyse both
successful and unsuccessful experiences in preventing
atrocity crimes

====================

We acknowledge that Governments bear the
primary responsibility for the protection of their own
citizens and emphasize that any use of force should be a
measure of last resort, duly authorized by the Security
Council on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the
Charter of the United Nations

====================

We have carefully examined the latest report of
Secretary-General Guterres (A/72/884) and share his
views on the importance of prioritizing prevention
across all the pillars of the work of the United Nations

====================

We fully support his assertion that inclusive and
sustainable development is the best form of prevention
against all kinds of risks. We therefore underscore
the need for strengthened international cooperation
in building a sustainable world with basic services
and protected human rights. It is critical to support
Member States in addressing the root causes of
conflict, including chronic poverty, illiteracy, food
insecurity and the adverse effects of climate change

====================

Equally important is capacity-building for more
effective and accountable institutions, appropriate
legislation and security and justice reform. We believe
that our preventive efforts will succeed only if they
rely on dialogue, confidence-building measures and
establishing partnerships with all relevant parties

====================

In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that
Kazakhstan is committed to working closely with

all the relevant parties to ensure the full protection
of populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity.
