And Accountability For
Prevention

United Nations

Statement of H.E. Archbishop Bernardito Auza,
Apostolic Nuncio and Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the
United Nations
at the Informal interactive dialogue on the
Report of the Secretary-General on the Responsibility to Protect:
The Responsibility to Protect and accountability for prevention
New York, 6 September 2017

Mr. President,
The Holy See would like to thank you for this opportunity to address the critical importance of
the Responsibility to Protect and of accountability for prevention

====================

The report of the Secretary General opens with an honest admission that there is “a gap between
our stated commitment to the Responsibility to Protect and the daily reality confronted by
populations exposed to the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity.”[1] Closing this gap is a collective responsibility that calls all of us to urgent action

====================

The Responsibility to Protect is intrinsic to the relationship between those who govern and the
governed as well as being an essential element of the common good. There is universal
consensus that this primary responsibility of individual States to protect their own populations is
the first pillar of the norm

====================

Although the Responsibility to Protect has been defined only very recently, during the 2005
World Summit,[2] in fact it has always been implicit in the idea that gave birth to the United
Nations. During the first part of the sixteenth century, when the concept of national sovereign
States was emerging, the Dominican Friar Francisco de Vitoria, rightly considered one of the
fathers of international law and of those concepts that eventually developed into the United
Nations, described the responsibility of governors to protect their own subjects as an aspect of
natural reason shared by all nations, and a rule for an “international” order whose task it was to
regulate relations between peoples.[3] Today there is also a more-or-less general political
consensus that this collective responsibility of all States is the second pillar of the norm

====================

There is a growing consensus that the international community, through the United Nations, also
has the responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in
accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter, to help to protect populations from
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. In this context, countries
have agreed that they should be prepared to take collective action, in a timely and decisive
manner, through the Security Council, in accordance with the Charter, including Chapter VII, on
a case-by-case basis and in cooperation with relevant regional organizations as appropriate,
should peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities be manifestly failing to protect
their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity

====================

The greatest challenge in the implementation of the Responsibility to Protect lies in this third
pillar. That is why this pillar was at the core of the deliberations of world leaders in defining the
principle during the 2005 World Summit. Confronted by the evidence that the increasing number
of atrocity crimes committed in recent decades was due to the failure of individual States to
protect their own populations, coupled with the difficulties of the international community in
exercising its collective responsibility in this regard, the third pillar was and remains a wake up
call to the international community to overcome such difficulties vis-à-vis mass atrocities

====================

Consensus, sincerity, transparency, mutual trust and the adequate reform of articles 2.7 and 39 of
the UN’s Charter, are meant to be the answer to the potential opposition between national
sovereignty and outside intervention. Strengthening the third pillar and making it “more
workable” are key to a “timely and decisive” implementation of the Responsibility to Protect

====================

Mr. President,
The Holy See upholds the perennial validity of the Responsibility to Protect and wishes to
reaffirm its commitment to this principle and call for its full, impartial and consistent
implementation. Such an application means, as the report of the Secretary General recommends,
meeting obligations under international human rights and international humanitarian law, and
condemning deliberate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructures. It means preventing
or stopping atrocity crimes and protecting populations from them through greater legal, political
and moral accountability. The Holy See thus supports those initiatives that will facilitate the
observance of obligations under the Responsibility to Protect, such as the Code of Conduct
regarding Security Council action against genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity, as
well as the inclusion of mandates to protect civilians in peacekeeping operations

====================

Finally, the Holy See would like to highlight the increasing importance of the concrete
implementation of the Responsibility to Protect in the context of the migration and refugee
crises. The use of threats to commit atrocity crimes against populations or the actual commission
thereof as a strategy to displace them forcibly must be condemned, prevented or stopped. Both
the right of all to remain in their own homelands and the right to return and regain possession of
property must also be enforced under the norm

====================

Over and above every consideration, our common humanity impels us all to assist the victims of
atrocity crimes and to respond in solidarity to their needs in the most humane and fraternal way
possible. When the international community fails to exercise adequately the Responsibility to
Protect, we all have a great and urgent responsibility, as Pope Francis has proposed, to welcome,
to protect, to promote and to integrate the victims of those failures.[4]
Thank you Mr. President
