I have the honour to
speak on behalf of the 12 members of the Pacific small
island developing States. I align this statement with
the statement to be delivered on behalf of the Pacific
Islands Forum

====================

I would like to thank the President for this
opportunity to address Member States. We acknowledge
the inclusion of this important topic in the formal agenda
of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session

====================

suffered either directly or indirectly from deliberate
and indiscriminate attacks, experienced the loss of
livelihoods, been forced to flee their homes, suffered
sexual abuse, or been denied access to humanitarian aid
and proper medical care

====================

The United Nations remains the most uniquely
placed multilateral organization for establishing
norms and assisting in and enforcing the protection
of civilians. The outcome of the 2005 World Summit
on the responsibility to protect (R2P) empowers the
United Nations to play that leading role on R2P. Earlier
this year, in his address to the Security Council at the
debate on the protection of civilians in armed conflicts,
the Secretary-General highlighted that “while
the normative framework has been strengthened,
compliance has deteriorated” (S/PV.8534, p. 2). The
Secretary-General’s report in June on the responsibility
to protect highlights that gaps continue to exist between
our stated commitment and the reality on the ground
(A/73/898). We therefore urge action to address those
gaps. Respect for international conventions, awareness
and accountability should be the foundation of R2P

====================

We acknowledge the link between the Human
Rights Council and the Security Council and
encourage the further strengthening of such links

====================

Our institutions and mechanisms based in Geneva
can play an important role in preventing mass atrocity
crimes. We are encouraged that one of our own from
the region currently sits on the Human Rights Council,
thereby demonstrating the importance we place on such
bodies. The unique experiences and challenges within
our Pacific Islands region provide us with a heightened
sensitivity towards ensuring that the voices of the most
vulnerable are not overlooked

====================

The protection of people all over the world
irrespective of creed, ethnicity and affiliation is at the
heart of the United Nations and amply embodied in the
Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations — We the
Peoples. Earlier this year, a ceremony was held in this
very Hall to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary
of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. It
was a stark reminder of what happens when we, as the
international community, fail to act

====================

The Pacific has in place a number of regional
security cooperation arrangements, the most recent
being the Boe Declaration, which was adopted by our
Pacific leaders in Nauru in September 2018. The Boe
Declaration recognizes that prevention and collective
action is critical for the protection of our peoples. The
Boe Declaration goes even further in recognizing
the multidimensional nature of security, cutting
across a number of areas, including the environment

====================

The existence of our regional security cooperation
arrangements is a testament to our commitment as
a region

====================

As we meet today, there are still many around
the world suffering as a result of conflicts. They have
