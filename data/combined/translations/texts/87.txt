General Assembly informal interactive dialogue
On the Report of the Secretary-General on the
Responsibility to Protect
Statement by H.E. Mr. Matthew Rycroft, CBE
Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations
6 September 2017 – New York
Thank you for convening this important meeting and thank you to all of the previous speakers,
including the Secretary-General and President of the General Assembly. I’d like to focus on a
couple of issues that the Secretary-General covered in his report—firstly conflict prevention and
secondly accountability

====================

On the first, over the past year, we’ve continued to see that those at greatest risk of atrocity
crimes are those in areas of ongoing conflict—places like Yemen, South Sudan, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and sadly, the list goes on and on. So, we believe that the best and most
decisive way to prevent atrocities is to prevent and manage conflicts in the first place and to do
that better than we currently are. We must do more than we are doing at the moment. So, we
support the Secretary-General and his good offices and his team using their powers under the UN
Charter to focus the attention of the Security Council whenever there are worrying developments
at the earliest opportunity. Such early warning is the first step

====================

The second step is of course early action. We recognize as permanent members of the Security
Council that the Council must do a better job than it currently is at turning that early warning into
early action and to overcome the divisions which otherwise prevent us from taking meaningful
action and protecting people who then face mass atrocities

====================

But there are things that the UN itself can do too, including overcoming barriers that get in the
way of preventive action and the Secretary-General’s reform agenda, particularly his focus on
improving prevention will be vital if we are to move towards action in this area of preventing
atrocities. We welcome his call for greater cross-pillar working and we support the whole agenda
of sustaining peace

====================

On the second point, the UK welcomes the focus on accountability in this year’s report. The UK
has a longstanding commitment to bring perpetrators of atrocity crimes to justice and I want to
particularly highlight the work we’ve been doing with the government of Iraq, following their
request to the Security Council to get a Security Council resolution that would allow the
implement of a mechanism to preserve the evidence of crimes committed in Iraq by Da’esh that
eventually those that have committed those crimes are held to account. The resolution would
establish a team to collect and preserve evidence of Da’esh’s crimes in Iraq. That’s a good step
towards accountability for Da’esh’s crimes but for by no means the end of the road. We will not
relent in our efforts to hold those responsible to account and in doing so, I very much hope we
send a message to all those who seek to harm civilians that there is no room to act with impunity

====================

So finally, I just want to reiterate the UK’s commitment to the responsibility to protect doctrine
as a signatory of the ACT code of conduct and as a permanent member of the Security Council

====================

It’s a responsibility we take very seriously and will continue to support discussion of the
responsibility to protect
