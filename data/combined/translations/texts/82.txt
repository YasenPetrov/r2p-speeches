General Assembly Informal Interactive Dialogue
on

the Report of the Secretary-General entitled “Implementing the
Responsibility to Protect: Accountability for Prevention”

6 September 2017

Intervention by
H.E. Ambassador Katalin Bogyay

Permanent Representative Mr. President,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We thank the Secretary-General for his forward-looking 9" report, which is the
first by SG Antonio Guterres. We really appreciate and welcome the results of the
report, which reaffirms that R2P is still in the focus of the UN’s attention and
provides a clear and realistic view of the challenges Member States, the United
Nations and regional organizations have to face while implementing the principle
of the responsibility to protect

====================

Since the UN’s establishment some 72 years ago, perhaps our greatest failure has
been our inability to always protect civilians against atrocity crimes. Although we
are deeply concerned about the worldwide negative trends, we share the view
expressed in the report that prevention of atrocity is the first step to implement
R2P. However, taking into account the growing number of conflicts on
international and national levels, it is inevitable to think also about steps to be
taken to address atrocity crimes that have already happened

====================

Since the adoption of the principles on the R2P in 2005, we are fully committed
to raise the awareness on this issue on national and international level as well

====================

Hungary is a proud member of the Friends of R2P Group and a party to all
important Conventions related to mass atrocities and war crimes

====================

Hungary — as an active member of the ACT Group — welcomes the reference in
the report to the Code of Conduct and the role of the Security Council. We
advocate for refraining voluntarily from the use of veto in the Security Council in
cases of mass atrocities and we encourage all Member States who have not yet
done so to support the Code of Conduct elaborated by the ACT Group and signed
by 113 Member States to date. We strongly support the efforts to transform
the principle of R2P into an agenda for concrete action and we agree with the
comprehensive approach when addressing the issue of accountability,

As a clear sign of our commitment to prevent atrocities, Hungary takes actions
through education, remembrance and commemoration, and zero tolerance policy:

e The Hungarian government introduced the policy of zero tolerance against
anti-semitism and xenophobia. Moreover, the education of the Holocaust
is compulsory and is an integral part of the national curriculum. The
Holocaust Remembrance Day is observed in public schools since 2000

====================

Hungary held the presidency of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance in 2015. The Hungarian Criminal Code penalizes
genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and hate speech as well

====================

e Hungary has signed the joint statement on the “Principles for UN Global
Leadership on Preventing Violent Extremism”, proposed by the UK, and
we call on all Member States to do so. With this step, we support the
implementation of the Secretary General’s Plan of Action on
Preventing Violent Extremism through an all-of-UN approach

====================

As regards the institutional framework of reviewing mechanisms, I would

emphasize the followings:

°

We have various alternatives for international response, thus we
support efforts to use existing fora in a more efficient and
coordinated manner, and we welcome the practical approach of the
report and the guidance given to states, regional and international
fora aiming to help the implementation of R2P norms. In this regard
we strongly support utilizing mechanisms of the Human Rights
Council, even more so in these times, since Hungary has been
elected a member of the UN Human Rights Council

We must recognize the important role of civil society in supporting
the advancement of R2P. We also support to using the Universal
Periodic Review process to address atrocity prevention gaps and to
considering further exploration of the responsibility to protect by the
Security Council

====================

We must dedicate special attention to ending impunity and
ensuring justice for victims of atrocities, including trial-based
mechanisms and other forms of transitional justice

====================

We appreciate the efforts taken by the International Fact-Finding
Commission (IHFFC) to implement and ensure respect for
International Humanitarian Law (IHL) in armed conflict
situations, and welcome the request by OSCE to the IHFFC to
conduct an independent forensic investigation, the first task since the
establishment of the Commission in 1991. We also encourage states
to make better use of good offices of the IHFFC

====================

Hungary is still a staunch supporter of the International,
Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) on international
crimes committed in the Syrian Arab Republic. Related to NGOs, international forums, regional cooperation, | would also
mentioned some facts:

o Hungary hosts the Budapest Centre for the International
Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities, which provides an
invaluable input that can contribute to effective and timely action
aimed at preventing the commitment of atrocity crimes: in institution
building, technical assistance, early warning capacity building, best
practice advice and persistent attention to the warning signs. Such
warning sign can be the emerging presence of extremism in our
societies

====================

o In2008, Hungary launched the Budapest Human Rights Forum, a
series of annual international human rights conferences attended
by national and international human rights experts, representatives
of international organizations, non-governmental organizations and
governments

====================

o In 2016, one of the panels of the 9" Budapest Human Rights
Forum was dedicated to the human rights aspects of the prevention
of mass atrocities and the responsibility to protect

====================

o Regarding this topic, I would highlight that in May 2017 the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, in cooperation
with the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, hosted an
international Conference on “Victims of armed conflicts at the
juncture of international humanitarian law and human rights
law”. The Conference concentrated on the prevention aspect and
brought together academics from various universities, experts and
government representatives from a number of countries to discuss
the interrelation between international humanitarian law and human
rights law with a focus on issues relating to compliance,
accountability and fact-finding. The Hungarian MFAT plans to
organize IHL-related conferences on a regular basis

====================

o Inthe ’Visegrad Group‘, Hungary, with Poland, the Czech Republic
and Slovakia cooperates in developing national and regional
mechanisms to serve the Responsibility to Protect idea

====================

We kindly request the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres to place atrocity
prevention at the heart of his overall prevention platform in advance. In this
regard, Hungary strongly supports for the work of the Special Advisers and their
Office in the context of the ongoing reform process in the organization. We believe that with strengthened political will of Member States and better use
of already existing wide range of tools, the international community could
effectively prevent and end mass atrocities

====================

I thank you, Mr. President!
