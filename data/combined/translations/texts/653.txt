SPEECH BY THE DELEGATION OF CHILE IN THE INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE
GENERAL ASSEMBLY ON THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL
"RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT: A DECISIVE AND TIMELY RESPONSE"

Thank you Mr. President,
I first of all thank the Secretary-General's report "Accountability
Protect: A timely and decisive response "

====================

My delegation also gratefully acknowledges the work of ex - Asesores
Special for the Prevention of Genocide and Responsibility to Protect,
Messrs. Francis Deng and Ed Luck, respectively, for the excellent work
throughout their mandates. Also, I want to welcome you, Mr. President,
its new high functions and can count on the full support of my delegation

====================

Finally, I thank the panelists excellent and illustrative presentations

====================

Mr. President,
My delegation welcomes the report of the SG, which proposes to States
Members a clear guide to using all available tools and
United Nations Charter to deal with a case of crisis in which a
Determined state being committed any of the four crimes that treats
Responsibility to Protect

====================

Mr. president
As well as the report of the Secretary-General, the three pillars of the
Responsibility to Protect: State responsibility to protect its
civilian population of the aforementioned four crimes, the obligation of the community
international to cooperate with that State when necessary and finally his
duty react so firmly to the commission of such crimes are
feed back and their application is not consecutive, but must apply the
most appropriate according to a given situation and always agree
to the provisions of the UN Charter

====================

Timely and decisive response of the international community is vital, whether it
under Chapters VI, VII or VIII of the Charter. Without the possibility of such
response, this debate would not be an academic discussion. The answer
It should not necessarily be by use of force. Charter
Organization provides a wide range of possible reactions by using
instrument of peaceful pressure to bring to an outlet in a situation
crisis

====================

No doubt that prevention is an essential pillar of the responsibility to protect and
It is clear that while the international community more invested in prevention,
consolidate democratic institutions so that they can operate with full respect
human rights, there will be less risk that committed these four
crimes

====================

However, and unfortunately, these crimes occur and when has not been
possible to avoid them is to stop them necessary and should be applied here, as stated
and report of the Secretary-General, that pillar that is most appropriate to the situation
concrete. In this regard and as noted above, to apply the
Responsibility to Protect is not a requirement consequential application of
pillars. Yes that must implement the measures necessary and fair for that
case offers the Charter itself in Chapters VI, VII and VIII

====================

When circumstances leave no other alternative than applying the
Chapter VII sanctions and therefore must be authorized by the Council
Security, the main body should be able to reach an agreement and power
adopt appropriate measures. It is regrettable inability to make a decision
when these crimes continue to occur

====================

Moreover, once it has taken the decision to implement a measure under
Chapter VII, the mandate should be clear and specific and there should be regular reports
members of the Council. This helps to greater transparency and legitimacy
to UN membership

====================

Finally,
I note the statement by the Secretary-General, referring to the lessons learned
from 2005 on R2P, as regards the role of regional organizations,
particularly as regards to early warning and applying means
prevention

====================

At this point, my delegation stresses the role that civil society and NGOs
who usually are the first to capture signals that risk
commit these four crimes

====================

Thank you very much, Mr. President
