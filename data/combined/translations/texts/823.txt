At a time when
atrocities committed in various corners of the world
persist in causing unprecedented human suffering, it is
essential for the international community to continue to
address the issue of preventing the occurrence of such
crimes. In this respect, we welcome the inclusion of
agenda item 168, “The responsibility to protect and the
prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity”, on the formal agenda of
the General Assembly again this session

====================

We thank the Secretary-General for his
comprehensive annual report on the responsibility to
protect, this year entitled “Responsibility to protect:
lessons learned for prevention” (A/73/898), which
constitutes a solid basis for our deliberations today. We
also welcome the appointment of Ms. Karen Smith as
the new Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on
the Responsibility to Protect

====================

At the 2005 World Summit, Member States made
a landmark commitment on their responsibility to
protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity. The SecretaryGeneral’s report highlights the growing gap between our
words of commitment and the experience of protecting
vulnerable populations around the world. It is clear that
civilians are the ones that pay the highest price when
Member States fail to uphold their responsibility to
protect. In order to prevent and alleviate this immense
human suffering, the international community needs to

consider efficient ways and means to narrow the gap
between its commitments and actions

====================

In his report, the Secretary-General elaborates on
the role of the individual States and the engagement
of the international community in response to the
occurrence or risk or occurrence of atrocity crimes by
taking timely and sustained action. We appreciate his
recommendations and conclusions to this end

====================

In this context, the report cites guarantees of
non-recurrence, which involves addressing historic
cases of atrocity crimes, as one of the principal areas
to focus on to facilitate prevention of such crimes. We
believe that in order to establish the truth and build
mutual understanding, cases should be studied, taking
into account all their aspects, including their legal
dimension and historical background. In so doing,
it is essential that we proceed through dialogue, on
the basis of the cooperation and engagement of all
parties, including with the help of such platforms as
joint historical commissions. As rightly stated in the
report, we should respect diversity and peacefulness by
emphasizing different perspectives

====================

We also find it important that addressing hate
speech is included in the report as the first example of
an early action. Countering hate speech and bringing
perpetrators of hate crimes to justice is a collective
responsibility of States, communities and the private
sector. We acknowledge the development of the United
Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech
that was launched last week by the Secretary-General
as an important step forward and support his active
stance on this issue

====================

The responsibility to protect has yet to be
considered an established norm of international law,
and its scope and implementation need to be defined
and refined. The efforts in that regard should not be
carried out in a way that reinterprets or renegotiates
the well-established principles of international law
and the existing legal framework. Crimes of genocide,
war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity are well-defined legal concepts. We should
implement the relevant legal framework faithfully
and consistently. We should also bear in mind that
the concept of the responsibility to protect seeks to
establish a delicate balance between safeguarding the
humanitarian concerns of the international community
while respecting the principle of national sovereignty

====================

Pursuing a non-selective approach vis-à-vis the

implementation of the concept is relevant if we are
to achieve the widest possible consensus among the
membership on this important issue

====================

We welcome the Secretary-General’s approach,
which has a central focus on prevention. Indeed,
prevention is one of the most effective instruments in
our toolbox. Turkey believes that preventive policies
and mediation efforts should play a more prominent
role. In that understanding, Turkey pioneers mediation
efforts not only in the United Nations but also through
regional and bilateral initiatives. When efforts aimed
at prevention do not succeed, United Nations organs,
including the Security Council, must remain ready to
assume their responsibilities as enshrined in the Charter
of the United Nations. We hope that the discussions on
the responsibility to protect and its implementation will
also contribute to the efforts aimed at restraining the use
of the veto in the Security Council where crimes against
humanity and the crime of genocide are concerned

====================

Before concluding, I would like to underscore
that ensuring accountability for crimes that have been
committed should also be an indispensable component
of our discussions. Accountability is essential not only
to avoiding impunity and delivering justice but also to
preventing the recurrence of atrocities in the future.
