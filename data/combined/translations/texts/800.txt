(spoke in Arabic):
My delegation would like to speak in explanation of
vote before the voting on draft resolution A/73/L.94,
entitled “Towards torture-free trade: examining the
feasibility, scope and parameters for possible common
international standards”

====================

The delegation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
regrets that the amendments it presented during

the negotiations with the co-sponsors were not
incorporated in the draft resolution. We hoped to
establish and promote the principle of consensus among
all parties with a view to reaching a draft text that was
acceptable to all and reflected all views. My delegation
also expresses its regret over the way in which the
negotiations were conducted. There was no flexibility
and only one voice was heard

====================

We would like to point out that the draft resolution
includes ambiguous and unclear paragraphs that
contradict its title, which reflects a noble objective
that we support. However, we would like to clarify the
points of objection as follows

====================

First, the language of the draft resolution can be
attributed to resolution 61/89, entitled “Towards an
arms trade treaty: establishing common international
standards for the import, export and transfer of
conventional arms”. That resolution dealt with
weapons, not torture. The co-sponsors of the draft
resolution copied and pasted certain paragraphs from
the resolution without any amendments except to delete
the mention of weapons and replace it with torture and
capital punishment in a manner that was not professional
or logical

====================

Secondly, capital punishment does not contravene
the provisions of international law or international
conventions, including the Convention against Torture

====================

Consequently, capital punishment is not considered
torture. In that regard, my delegation would like to
reiterate that capital punishment in the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia is applied only against the most
atrocious crimes and in very limited circumstances, in
accordance with national laws, and only after a clear
condemnation in line with the law and a transparent
and fair trial. All cases of capital punishment are legally
and judicially reviewed by more than 10 judges through
various phases

====================

Thirdly, in the last round of negotiations the
co-sponsors circulated a list containing a number of
goods that are used for torture, which reflects a good
effort. However, for the sake of transparency, that
list could have been included in one of the operative
paragraphs in order to ensure clarity and end ambiguity
that could be deliberate. Hence there would be a
linkage between free trade and human rights, leading
to new legal grounds for the prohibition of exporting
or importing certain goods based on political, not
commercial, motives

====================

Fourthly, my delegation believes that there was
unjustified urgency on the part of the co-sponsors
of the draft resolution. Paragraph 1 requests the
Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States
on the feasibility of establishing common international
standards for the import, export and transfer of goods
used for capital punishment or torture or other cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It
further requests the Secretary-General to submit a
report on the subject to the General Assembly at its
seventy-fourth session

====================

Paragraph 2 of the draft resolution also requests the
Secretary-General to establish a group of governmental
experts, to be chosen on the basis of equitable
geographical distribution. It would have been better to
wait and consider the views of States and the outcome
of paragraph 1 and then establish a new mechanism if
need be

====================

In conclusion, my delegation asserts the inherent
right of States to apply their national laws in a manner
that maintains their security and stability. States
Members of the United Nations should respect and
preserve that right. Based on that, my country will vote
against the draft resolution and we call on all States to
do the same.
