Statement delivered by France – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2016
[TRANSLATION]

Mr. Special Advisor,

France aligns itself with the statements delivered by the European Union and the Group of Friends of R2P

====================

On behalf of my government, I would like to thank the Special Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide, Mr

====================

Adama Deng, whose declaration we considered carefully, and yourself, Mr. Special Advisor for R2P. We
congratulate you for your commitment and for the quality of your work. The quality of this debate is a
testimony of this commitment

====================

R2P is the judicial, political and moral framework, to employ the report’s terminology, to which we have
agreed in 2005 to prevent atrocities and which comprise 3 interconnected pillars: the primary
responsibility of the State to protect its population, the collective responsibility to reinforce States’
capacity to meet that responsibility and the one to act in cases of failure

====================

We must progress on all of these pillars, as we are doing on the fight against impunity, which is a central
element of the ninth report on R2P

====================

The ICC is an excellent example in that matter. Based on the principle of complementarity, the ICC only
exercises its competency when a given state is either unwilling or unable to prosecute those responsible
for egregious crimes. France wants to reaffirm its supports and its faith in this institution. The universal
ratification of the Rome Statute remains a key to the implementation of R2P

====================

Supporting the others international and mixed jurisdictions is another. To this regard, we thank the UNDP,
and the MINUSCA for their support to the Special Court in the Central African Republic. We also encourage
states to examine the Convention on Crimes against Humanity project, proposed by the International Law
Commission. Adopting such a convention on States’ obligations in prosecuting and cooperating in
situations of crimes against humanity, would constitute a decisive contribution in the fight against
impunity and in implementing R2P

====================

Mr. Special Advisor,

As noted by the SG in his report, a gap still separates the declared commitment of the UN for R2P and the
reality faced by populations in war-torn countries, in Central African Republic, Yemen, Democratic

Republic of the Congo or Burundi. The Syrian conflict entered its seventh years, the humanitarian situation
there is dramatic

====================

In the face of such overwhelming challenges, it is essential that the Security Council is not paralyzed. The
veto is a responsibility and the Council must be able, in particular in mass atrocity situations, to respond

====================

This is why France, alongside Mexico, proposed a concrete measure: the commitment by the five
permanent members of the Council, on a voluntary and collective basis, to renounce the use of the veto
when mass atrocity are at play. I noticed that this initiative has been included in the report and we are
delighted of the support expressed by many delegations in this matter

====================

As recommended by the SG in his report, it is essential to reinforce coordination among various UN
entities, and to ensure the integration of the three pillars via the humanitarian-development nexus and
the security-development continuum, in order to fully utilize the early warning tools at our disposal

====================

Mr. Special Advisor, when we invoke R2P, we speak about a principle in motion that must be continuously
enriched. This is why France also believes that it should be included as a formal item on the General
Assembly agenda

====================

I thank you

====================
