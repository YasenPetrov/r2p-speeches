Statement by Adama Dieng, Special Adviser to the United Nations Statement by Adama
Dieng, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, on the situation in
central Mali
For Immediate Release
(New York, 27 March 2019) The United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide,
Adama Dieng, expressed his deepest concern and strongly condemns the attack on Ogossagou
Peulh village, Mopti region, in central Mali, on 23rd March 2019 in which, at least 134 civilians,
including women and children, were killed and at least 55 people were injured. This is the fourth
major attack since the start of the year against villages populated by Fulani/Peulhs in Bankass
cercle including the one that took place on 1st January in Kolougon Peulh in which 37 civilians
were killed

====================

The Office of the Special Adviser has been closely monitoring the situation in Mali since the
beginning of 2018 and has received reports indicating a serious upsurge in inter-communal
violence as well as negative impact of counterterrorism operations conducted by community-based
armed groups on the civilian populations in the region. There is growing ethnicization of the
conflict in central Mali, in which entire communities are being stigmatized as terrorists or as
affiliates of armed groups. This dynamic is not sufficiently recognized neither by national
authorities nor by the international community, who are focusing mostly on the peace process in
the north and on the threat posed by jihadist movements. The community based armed groups and
other armed actors have been carrying out targeted attacks against civilians in the context of the
fight against terrorism, committing serious violations and abuses of human rights including killings,
destruction of property, arbitrary detention and de facto embargos on villages, restricting
movement of civilian populations

====================

“Over the recent months, violence has reached unprecedented level amid retaliatory attacks and
serious violations of human rights in central Mali impacting on all communities. Unless these
concerns are immediately addressed, there is a high risk of further escalation of the situation in
which atrocity crimes could be committed.” Mr. Dieng said
To prevent further escalation of violence, the Special Adviser urges the Malian government, with
the support of the the international community, including MINUSMA to immediately address the
current grave upsurge of violence in central Mali and to provide, with no further delay, protection
as well as assistance to vulnerable population. “I call on the Malian government to urgently
investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of the recent attacks as well as those responsible for
serious violations and abuses of human rights.” Mr. Dieng reiterated. The Special Adviser also
called on the authorities and all Malians to prevent and refrain from stigmatizing entire
communities. The Office of the Special Adviser stands ready to provide support to local
reconciliation and inter-communal dialogue processes, with the aim of promoting inclusivity,
strengthening resilience and social cohesion
