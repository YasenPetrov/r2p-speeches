STATEMENT BY THE DELEGATION OF THE ECUADOR
INFORMAL INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE DURING THE
GENERAL ASSEMBLY ON LIABILITY
TO PROTECT
(9/11/2013)
Mr. president,
My delegation would like to express our satisfaction with the organization
This event allows us to express, clearly, the position of our
country on an issue of great importance to the International Community

====================

Resolution No. A / RES / 60/1 of 24 October 2005, he raised with
clearly the three pillars that must support the idea of ​​responsibility
Protect: 1) The State has the primary responsibility to protect
its population from genocide, war crimes, crimes against
humanity and ethnic cleansing, and incitement to the commission of such
offenses. 2) The international community is responsible for encouraging and assisting
States to exercise that responsibility within the limits of the law
International audience and, 3) The international community has
responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other
appropriate means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VII of Chart
UN to protect populations from these crimes, when it is clear
a State fails to protect its own population

====================

The commitment of the International Community to adopt measures
group indicated above it can only be given by the Council
Security and in accordance with the UN Charter. Any use of the
force outside this framework, it is illegal and illegitimate and constitutes a mere act
of aggression against a sovereign state, regardless of who commits it and
of the excuses used to justify

====================

Reaffirm, therefore, that unilateral and unauthorized participation by the
Security Council, in internal conflicts of a country and the
eventual regime change in a sovereign state, are outside the
concept of Responsibility to Protect and completely lacking
legal value

====================

For these reasons, Mr. President, we want to highlight two elements
substantial in the debate at hand:

First, the responsibility to protect is a concept
is still in the process of analysis and discussion among States
Members of the Organization and only the UN General Assembly
It has the legal capacity and moral authority to advance their definition

====================

Unilateral interpretations that make a State or group of
states have no binding force nor more than simple opinions
some states want to use as an umbrella to justify aggression
unlawful against other states

====================

And, secondly, in the reports presented by the SG on this topic
clearly recognized that the emergence of conflicts in the world
is linked to discrimination, marginalization and
exclusion, among other inequities, that is why the Constitution of the
Ecuador establishes clear rules to ensure the elimination
progressive of such situations

====================

My country recognizes that responsibility for protecting the population is
intrinsic to the notion of State Sovereignty, therefore we reject,
categorically claim to certain countries to reduce Principle
National sovereignty to a mere functional element and almost dispensable
anecdotal, that some governments want to ignore to facilitate
interventions masquerading as humanitarianism and who do not seek anything but
impose own political agendas or assault the natural resources of a
State to be divided among the members of aggressor coalitions

====================

Mr. President,
Ecuador considers that conflict prevention using
the means of peaceful settlement of disputes is the only legal way and
effective to prevent crimes committed indicated in paragraphs 138
and 139 of Resolution No. 60/1 October 24, 2005

====================

The best way to prevent conflict and route expeditiously to
strengthen national capacities lies in building trust,
confidence in law and public international law, as in
validity and respectability of the institutions established to implement it. By
It inconsistent it is the position of those who, by their actions, weaken
deliberately to UN bodies

====================

My country believes strongly in the role of regional and subregional organizations in the prevention of the crimes described above,
We agree in this regard as discussed in the report on the SG
"Responsibility to Protect; State responsibility and
Prevention "when he says that early warnings of crimes such as
genocide, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity or war
They can be detected in a timely manner by neighboring states
before the outbreak of a crisis of major proportions

====================

The delegation of Ecuador, as on previous occasions, reaffirmed today that
the legitimacy of the concept of Responsibility to Protect can only
based on the following elements: 1) establish very clearly the
reasons that can be considered sufficient to justify an intervention
international, 2) set with equal clarity and by analysis
"Case by case" the limits of possible intervention, excluding,
restrictively, regime change, or the usurpation of land or
natural resources of a State, 3) determine that the use of force must
be the last resort to be used after exhausting means peaceful solution
dispute and only under authorization of the Council
UN security as provided in Chapter VII of the Charter, 4) point
monitoring mechanisms to be given to any judgments
authorizing the use of force to prevent the limits are exceeded
set by the Security Council 5) ensure compliance with the
provisions of the UN Charter on the manner in which form the
military contingents acting on behalf of the international community,
preventing it "privatized" military operations

====================

My delegation will continue to participate actively in the discussions,
possibly allow us to define the meaning of responsibility
Protect, a concept that is still under discussion and will continue under
discussion until the UN General Assembly decides otherwise, in
whereby the recommendations of the Secretary-General included in his
Report N. A / 67/929 of 9 July this year, will be very welcome
as soon as an agreement is reached in the General Assembly on the
definition of the Responsibility to Protect and its scope as well as
how the reasons can be considered be established
enough to legitimize international intervention and how
It would be used, if necessary and as a last resort, military force
