Mr. President,
I have the honor of delivering this statement on behalf of 511
members of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect, cochaired this year by Denmark and the State of Qatar

====================

The Group would like to thank Germany for organizing today’s
important Open Debate. I also would like to extend our gratitude to
Nobel Peace Prize winners Dr. Denis Mukwege and Ms. Nadia Murad
for their informative briefings and persistent efforts to end the use of
sexual violence as a tactic of war and armed conflict

====================

Mr. President,
As the Secretary-General noted, sexual violence in conflict is a
“historically hidden crime” that requires early warning and swift
responses. Sexual violence, including rape, is not just a by-product
of war, but increasingly employed as a deliberate strategy by state
and non-state actors to retaliate against, terrorize, intimidate,
control and displace civilians. Such acts may amount to crimes
against humanity, war crimes, or genocide. Further, sexual violence
in conflict significantly exacerbates and prolongs situations of armed
conflict, destroys the social fabric of communities and impedes
peacebuilding and reconciliation efforts

====================

Sexual violence is a pervasive facet of many conflicts today,
claiming thousands of victims every year. In South Sudan, sexual
violence in conflict remains rampant, often used as collective
retribution against ethnic rivals. The United Nations Mission in South
Sudan reported 1,157 cases of sexual violence during 2018. And
these are only the reported cases in a context of notoriously
underreported incidents. Similarly, as Ms. Murad has attested, the
Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Botswana, Canada, Chile,
Costa Rica, Cote d’Ivoire, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, European Union, Finland, France,
Germany, Ghana, Guatemala, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Mali,
Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru,
Qatar, Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Romania, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Slovakia, Slovenia, South
Sudan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, United Kingdom, United States and Uruguay

====================

1

so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant has systematically
committed rape and sexual violence against Yazidi women and girls,
which the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria
has characterized as war crimes, crimes against humanity and
genocide

====================

As it is the primary responsibility of member states to protect
their populations against genocide, crimes against humanity, war
crimes and ethnic cleansing, including those involving rape and
sexual violence, the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect
would like to stress the following points:
First, strengthening the capacity of national institutions is
critical to ensuring accountability for such crimes in the past, and to
preventing and deterring such crimes in the future. It is of utmost
importance that states put in place and enforce legislative and
institutional procedures to comprehensively address sexual violence
in conflict and prevent its occurrence

====================

Despite the increased awareness of the issue, most incidents of
mass rape continue to be met with impunity. States have the primary
responsibility to investigate and prosecute crimes committed within
their jurisdiction, and national accountability efforts should be
encouraged and supported, including through the strengthening of
judicial cooperation between states. Fact-finding missions,
investigative mechanisms, commissions of inquiry, hybrid and
international courts and tribunals provide complementary avenues
for accountability when and where options under domestic law prove
insufficient

====================

Second, there is an urgent need for a survivor-centred approach
to support the needs of victims of sexual and gender-based violence
before, during and after situations of conflict. The international
community should support provision of appropriate medical, psychosocial and socioeconomic reintegration assistance and services to

survivors in order to prevent revictimization and restore the social
fabric of societies after conflict

====================

Third, at the heart of sexual violence lies a disregard for human
rights, as well as the perpetuation of gender inequality and
systematic discrimination. Sexual violence in conflict must be
addressed with the active and equal participation of women in
identifying prevention mechanisms and holistic, rights-based
solutions that address their needs. It is equally important to continue
to engage men and community leaders to play a positive role in
addressing gender stereotypes and societal exclusion mechanisms

====================

Fourth, the UN Security Council could and should make better
use of targeted sanctions to prevent and halt sexual violence –
including through basing listing criteria on involvement in the
perpetration of sexual violence

====================

In this context, the Special Representative of the SecretaryGeneral on Sexual Violence in Conflict and Panels of Experts should
consistently brief and give information on individuals or entities
responsible for committing sexual violence to sanctions committees,
encourage member states to list them, and recommend targeted
sanctions

====================

Lastly, training on gender issues, preventing sexual exploitation
and abuse, and addressing sexual violence in conflict should be a
mandatory component of national military and police training, as well
as pre-deployment and in-mission training of all UN peacekeeping
and civilian personnel. In this regard, we support the UN Zerotolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and welcome the
Secretary-General’s initiative on the Voluntary Compact between the
UN and Member States to prevent and eliminate sexual exploitation
and abuse

====================

Mr. President,
Sexual violence in conflict need not be an inevitable side effect
of armed conflict, it can be prevented and stopped. While significant
normative progress has been achieved in recent years, it is also clear
that words on paper are not yet matched by facts on the ground. In
this regard, it is imperative that the Members of the Security Council
take timely and decisive action aimed at ending and preventing
sexual violence in conflict, if and when they may amount to atrocity
crimes

====================

In closing, the Group of Friends of R2P would like to recognize
and pay tribute to the important work accomplished by Dr. Mukwege
and Ms. Murad, including providing critical medical and psycho-social
and socioeconomic reintegration support to the survivors of sexual
violence in conflict and addressing impunity for these heinous crimes

====================

We would like to ask how we, as members of the R2P community,
can more efficiently integrate gender considerations and prevention
of sexual violence into our work

====================

Thank you
