Informal interactive Dialogue on the Report of the Secretary General on
« Implementing the Responsibility to Protect: Accountability for Prevention »

New York, 6th of September 2017

Intervention of H.E. Mr. Christian Braun
Ambassador, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg

Mr. President,

Thank you for giving me the floor and for convening this Informal interactive Dialogue on
the Responsibility to Protect, a norm which my country is fully committed to

====================

Luxembourg subscribes to the statements made by the European Union and by the
Netherlands on behalf of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect

====================

I would like to thank Secretary-General Guterres for his report and welcome the emphasis
it puts on prevention and accountability

====================

Luxembourg welcomes the consultative approach for drafting this report and encourages
the Secretary-General to continue to pursue an open, frank and inclusive dialogue on the
responsibility to protect

====================

Furthermore, Luxembourg congratulates the Secretary-General for presenting a report that
describes the international situation as it is: alarming and frustrating, considering the
increasing number of deliberate attacks against civilians, notably women and children, in
countries like Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria or Yemen

====================

Despite welcome commitments by member states to prevent mass atrocity crimes, far
more energy is put into dealing with mass atrocities that already occurred than into their
prevention. Let there be no mistake: the three pillars of the responsibility to protect aim to
prevent atrocity crimes first and foremost. We must overcome the sterile and facile
accusations that the point of R2P is to provide an excuse for foreign interventions

====================

As stated by previous speakers, like the EU and the Netherlands, Luxembourg adheres to
the Secretary General’s view that accountability for mass atrocity crimes is an effective way
of preventing their recurrence. History teaches that a culture of impunity for perpetrators
of atrocity crimes leads to the repetition of these crimes. Accountability has to ensured, be
this through national or international criminal justice systems, like the International
Criminal court. Luxembourg acknowledges the important role of the Human Rights Council, and notably
the universal periodic review, the human rights treaty bodies and special procedure
mandate holders, highlighted in the Secretary-General’s report. We urge the international
community to make better use of these instruments at our disposal and resist any efforts to
weaken and sideline the UN Human Rights system

====================

Luxembourg acknowledges the central role of the Security Council and aligns with previous
member states who urge the Council's members to ensure that its central responsibility for
upholding international peace and security is met,

Finally, Luxembourg supports the report’s recommendations concerning the strengthening
of the General Assembly’s role and Supports Australia and Ghana’s request to include an
item on the responsibility to protect on the agenda of its 72"4 session,

Luxembourg believes the time has come for the General Assembly to pass a resolution
recognizing and Supporting this indispensable norm for the prevention of atrocity crimes,

Thank you!
