Statement of Ecuador

Thank you very much

====================

Sir, my delegation would like to express its pleasure at the holding of this event. My
government believes that this allows us to express the position of our government and
our country on a matter of great importance for the international community

====================

Resolution A/RES/60/1 of October 24th, 2005 put forth, with clarity, the Three Pillars,
that should sustain the Responsibility to Protect, R2P. First it stated [that] the primary
responsibility when it comes to protection its populations from genocide, war crimes,
crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and the incitation to the commission of these
crimes. Two, the international community is responsible for encouraging and helping
States to uphold this responsibility in the limits of international public law. And third,
the international community has the responsibility of using the diplomatic,
humanitarian and other appropriate means, pursuant to Chapter 6 and 7 of the United
Nations, to protect populations from these crimes when it is clear that a State is not
protecting its own population

====================

The commitment of the international community to adopting the collective measures
mentioned above can only come about through the Security Council and in step with the
UN Charter. Any use of force outside of this framework is illegal and illegitimate, and is
a mere act of aggression against a sovereign State, regardless of who commits it and the
pretext used to justify it. We reaffirm, hence, that the unilateral participation and
[participation] non-authorized [by the Security Council] in internal conflicts in a
country, as well as possible regime change of a sovereign state, is outside of the concept
of Responsibility to Protect and completely lacks legal standing

====================

For these reasons, we wish to underscore two substantial matters in this debate

====================

First, the Responsibility to Protect is a concept that is still being analyzed and discussed
among the Member States of the organization and only the General Assembly of the
United Nations has the legal [and moral] authority to move ahead in its definition

====================

Unilateral interpretations undertaken by a State, or group of States, does not have any
binding nature and are merely opinions of [those] States used to utilize these
illegitimate aggressions against other States

====================

Secondly, in the Report’s from Secretary-General in this topic, it is recognized clearly
that the arrival of conflicts in the world are tied situations marked by discrimination,
marginalization, exclusion and other inequalities. For this reason, Ecuador has set forth
clear concepts to eliminate the progressive arrival of these situations. My country
recognizes that the Responsibility to Protect is intrinsic to the notion of a sovereign
State. For this reason, we categorically reject the intent of some States to reduce the

principle of national sovereignty to a mere anecdotal and casual element, particularly by
those governments that are seeking to impose their own policies or to usurp the natural
resources of a State in order to redistribute them to the members of aggressive
coalitions. Equitably said, the prevention of conflicts through the use of peaceful
dispute settlement is the only legal and efficacious manner of avoiding the crimes that
are set forth in paragraphs 138 and 139 of Resolution 60/1 of 24 October 2005 come
about. The best way to prevent conflicts and the most expeditious away of strengthening
national capacity is in the building of trust and confidence in law and international
public laws which are already in place. It is for that reason that it is inconsistent to
move ahead with the stance of those whose actions undertake the bodies of the United
Nations. My country firmly believes in the roles of regional and sub-regional
organizations in the prevention of the aforementioned crimes. We agree then with that
expressed in the Secretary-General’s Report on the Responsibility to Protect, the
responsibility of States and prevention. When there are early warnings of crimes such
as genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes or crimes against humanity, when these
crimes can be detected in a timely manner by neighboring States before a greater crisis
arises. The delegation of Ecuador, as in previous occasions, reaffirms today that the
legitimacy of the concept of Responsibility to Protect can only be based on the following
elements…
1. The clear establishment of the motives that can be considered sufficient to
legitimize international intervention

====================

2. The establishment of clear case-by-case support on the eventual intervention
excluding the usurpation of a State or natural resources

====================

3. The use of force should be the last possible option after having exhausted all
peaceful dispute settlement mechanisms and under the exclusive authorization
of the Security Council under Chapter 7

====================

4. There must be a clear follow up on the mechanisms that are established in the
Resolutions on the use of force, in order to avoid excesses as set by the Security
Council

====================

5. There must be compliance with the provisions of the UN Charter on the way in
which the military would act on behalf of the international community

====================

My delegation will continue to participate actively in the debates. That in the end can
allow for a definition on the Responsibility to Protect. This concept is still in discussion,
it is still being debated and until the UN General Assembly decided otherwise

====================

The recommendations of the Secretary-General include his Report of 9 July will be very
welcome once an agreement is reached in the General Assembly on the definition of R2P
including the scope, thereof, including the manner in which those motives can be

determined as sufficient for legitimizing intervention and the manner in which it would
be used, it eventually being military strength

====================
