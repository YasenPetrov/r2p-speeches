The Peru welcomes the latest report of the Secretary-General on the responsibility of
States to protect their populations by preventing calls
heinous crimes, and the initiative of the President of the General Assembly to convene
this dialogue. It is a matter of utmost importance and timeliness. Facing the
clear breach of the responsibility to protect the Syrian population,
Government of Peru has condemned the violations of human rights and the right
international humanitarian observed. And we called on the international community
to make effective use of the mechanisms of collective security under the Charter
United Nations, particularly the Security Council, in order to achieve a
prompt solution. We believe and we sponsor the effectiveness of multilateralism and
general principles of the right to peacefully negotiated solutions
Conflicts like this

====================

Peru is a country that in recent history shows experiences and lessons
learned in the prevention of heinous crimes. We understand well, as
noted in the report of the Secretary-General: (i) the occurrence of such crimes
It is more likely in a process of internal violence; (Ii) that such crimes often have
as background a history of discrimination against a population group; and (iii)
the lack of state capacity increases the risk of occurrence

====================

In the 1980s and 1990s our country underwent a process of violence that killed
of about seventy thousand people and destroyed the infrastructure of the country, producing a
I huge delay in our development as a nation. The immediate responsibility and
key corresponds to totalitarian projects, supported by ideologies
fundamentalists. I mean Sendero Luminoso terrorist organizations and
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, defeated by the joint action of the State
and society. In our experience, they are also committed heinous crimes by
non-state actors,

The Peruvian case also shows the remarkable relationship between poverty and
social exclusion and the likelihood of being a victim of violence. And the
limitations shown by the State in its capacity to ensure security and
fundamental rights of its citizens within a democratic framework for action

====================

In a particularly complicated geography like Peru, the State has many
sometimes absent properly to prevent

====================

The report of the Secretary-General has not been picked up our particular experience and
surely that of several other countries that may be equally useful to know. By
This would note that in recent decades, with much effort, the Peruvian State
It has advanced substantially in the responsibility to protect its population. Are from
highlight the following preventive measures implemented by the scope Peru:

1. The full restoration of democracy and the rule of law

====================

2. The impetus priority of policies to combat poverty, social inclusion and
respect for cultural diversity, with a management system of social conflicts,

3. A specialized criminal justice system for human rights violations. At
Peru have judged primarily responsible for crimes against humanity,

of the Inter-American Human Rights and police cooperation and
international court

====================

4. A Commission of Truth and Reconciliation, which received nearly fourteen thousand
testimonies and offered the country's major conclusions about what happened

====================

5. An Integral Plan of Reparations for Victims of Violence, a
collective reparations program and individual

====================

6. Reforms in our security system. With a participatory,
we involve society in the fight against subversion and hold large
consensus on the need to protect our democracy

====================

7. An education program on human rights and law

====================

8. In general, both internally and externally, the Peru assigns
prominence to conflict prevention, to the general principles of the right,
fundamental rights and the peaceful settlement of disputes. In
particular Peru cooperates with international legal institutions, including

the International Criminal Court

Mr. Moderator:

From experience, Peruvians know that no country is free from the risk of
suffer heinous crimes. It has taken a lot of effort to adopt these measures
preventive, and build a resilient society to the atrocities that occurred in decades
past. As a result today we are a country at peace and stable, one of the countries in the
world's fastest growing reducing poverty. In terms of Responsibility to Protect,
Peru has developed a series of knowledge and skills, structural and
operational, which today can put the service of the international community
