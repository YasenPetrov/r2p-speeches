Armenia’s Statement at the 2016 UN General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion, From
Commitment to Implementation: Ten Years of Responsibility to Protect [Transcribed]
26 February 2016
Thank you very much, Moderator, and given the strict time limitations, I would start with the
generic big appreciation and thank you to Jennifer Welsh and the panelists for the excellent
initiative, and very interesting dialogue. This appreciation comes from a country which has been
very engaged over many years in promoting the concepts of prevention and protection from and
punishment for atrocity crimes and all other crimes

====================

My focus within this time limit would be on the culture of prevention and I would like to reflect on
the points made by Madame Pillay. She brought up this example of the hate speech being
cultivated over years in one case, which then resulted in an atrocity crime. The capacity of the
international community to respond to that, the responsibility; that is one way of reflecting on
Responsibility to Protect. The capacity of the international community to react to that, to identify
and to see various situations through the prism of the risks of atrocity crimes that are
happening. They are abundant around us. So it is very much about the capacity to develop the
culture of prevention. There are many norms and of course the legal obligations in the
protection of human rights, international humanitarian law obligations, many other instruments,
one of them which we consistently commend that was developed by special advisor ­ the
framework analysis ­ are those many instruments and norms that are available to us

====================

The other point I wanted to react to is the point on the scope of responsibility ­ from state
responsibility to individual responsibility. It is also the culture, the capacity to cultivate culture, of
seeing through events which might result in such atrocities. We might want to think about to
what extent the debates matter to those who are going through such situations. I started and
wish to end on the point of the culture of prevention. Thank you

====================
