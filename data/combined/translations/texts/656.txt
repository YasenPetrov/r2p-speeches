Statement of Ambassador P.R. of Spain Fernando Arias González
Informal Interactive dialogue of the General Assembly about the Secretary General’s
report on Responsibility to Protect
Thank you Mr. President. I´d like my first words to be of appreciation for the task
carried out by the previous UN Secretary-General Special Advisers for the
Responsibility to Protect, Mr. Edward Luck and for the Prevention of Genocide ,
Francis Deng; My congratulations, Mr. President, for your recent appointment as UN
Secretary-General Special Adviser for the Prevention of Genocide. I wish you great
success in your management and rest assured that you count with Spain’s total support

====================

Spain associates itself entirely with the EU’s statement, and in its national competency
would like to add the following appreciations

====================

Spain firmly supports the concept of Responsibility to Protect just as it was delineated
by Heads of state during the 2005 World Summit and in successive reports by the
Secretary-General. In the same way, Spain has supported the UN system’s pertinent
instances whenever this principle has been invoked to exhort states to fulfil the
responsibility that the exercise of sovereignty implies

====================

The concept of sovereignty as a responsibility has been mentioned today. The exercise
of a “responsible sovereignty” demands decisive and timely action on the behalf of the
international community. Echoing the words of the Secretary General in reference to the
suffering of the Syrian people, inaction is not an option. Inaction erodes the faith of our
citizens in the United Nations system

====================

Mr. President, as seen during the course of this debate, even if the concept of
Responsibility to protect is completely settled, it’s still necessary to forge consensus
about the methods used in its implementation. It’s important to consider the different
sensibilities of member states and regional groups. In this direction, both the Brazilian
initiative Responsabilidad al Proteger, and the Secretary General’s report provide
clarity: the principles of R2P must be applied with maximum coherence and uniformity

====================

Nonetheless, the choice of instruments, without excluding any of the ones the UN
Charter puts at the international community’s disposition, will depend on each case’s
specific circumstances

====================

It’s essential to recognize that the invocation of the third pillar, in other words, a
decisive and timely action, the object of today’s debate, compiles a wide range of
options. It’s up to us to ponder and define with more clarity the conditions, modalities,
requirements, possibilities, degree of execution, and as has been adequately mentioned
by Subsecretary General Simoniovic, the consequences of the option of choice. It would
be wrong to limit the debate about instruments to be used solely to coercive measures,
and amongst these to the military dimension: this distorts de concept of R2P

====================

Amongst these measures, Spain grants special importance to preventive diplomacy and
mediation, an evident example of the existing correlation between the second and third
pillars

====================

In this instance, allow me to remind you that during the ministerial week of the 67th
General Assembly, next September 28th the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs and
Cooperation, together with his Moroccan homologue, will launch the initiative for
mediation in the Mediterranean region. Said initiative, which was announced in the
frame of the 66th General Assembly and counts with the participation of the Secretariat,
has a vocation to develop national mediation capacities and to coordinate the different
actors in the Mediterranean scope

====================

To end my speech I would like to request the panellists’ comments regarding two
aspects of the report which I consider of particular interest but that have nonetheless not
received particular attention today

====================

Firstly, a greater interlocution with civil society will enrich the debate and may facilitate
early and effective response

====================

Secondly, I would like to highlight the role of humanitarian agencies, whose actions
must nonetheless not be a substitute nor be mistaken with political action, which
belongs to R2P. Humanitarian response is governed by the principles of humanity,
impartiality, independence and neutrality and its efficiency depends on the guarantee of
the humanitarian space
