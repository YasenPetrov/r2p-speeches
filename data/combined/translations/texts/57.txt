Informal interactive dialogue of the General Assembly on the responsibility to protect
06 September 2017

Statement by Mr. Tofig F. Musayev
Counsellor of the Permanent Mission
of the Republic of Azerbaijan to the United Nations

Mr. Moderator,

At the outset, | would like to thank the Secretary-General for his report and for particular
focus on preventive diplomacy

====================

The report of the Secretary-General acknowledges the existing gap between the stated
commitments and the daily reality confronted by a number of risks and challenges

====================

Indeed, efforts towards for the protection and vindication of rights and the prevention and
punishment of international crimes have not always been consistent and successful

====================

As practice shows, the objective of ensuring a peaceful, just and prosperous world be
hardly achievable if the universally recognized fundamental values, norms and principles
are misinterpreted, conditioned or implemented with reservations. Indeed, the harsh
reality is that where the political interests and double standards prevail, international law
and any commitments become ineffective

====================

As a consequence, civilians continue to suffer from inadequate protection and
discriminatory treatment in armed conflict and other crises

====================

Furthermore, despite existing evidence, repeated appeals and calls for action, not all
grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, in particular those
committed in protracted conflicts, receive due attention and a response at the
international and regional levels

====================

We concur with the Secretary-General: it is imperative to put an end to those negative
trends, and we have a responsibility to do so

====================

Resolute and targeted measures are required to that end. Such measures must be free of
selectivity and politically motivated approaches

====================

The imperative of shedding light on real facts is undeniable. Combatting impunity for the
most serious crimes of concern to the international community can help prevent their
recurrence, restore the dignity of victims, enable reconciliation and promote sustainable
peace

====================

When national authorities fail to take the steps necessary in that regard, the international

community should play a more proactive role and consider all legal options and practical
steps to ensure an appropriate response and justice for all victims. Special attention must be given to the protection of civilians forced to leave their homes
as a result of armed conflict and unlawful foreign military occupation. Azerbaijan
supports the continuing efforts towards raising awareness of the problem of internal
displacement and ensuring the effective implementation of the right of return

====================

It is important that peace efforts never encourage, accept or tolerate the situations
achieved by the unlawful use of force and other egregious violations of international law,
such as war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and ethnic cleansing

====================

It is pertinent to recall that serious breaches of obligations arising from peremptory norms
of general international law (jus cogens) call for the application of the special
consequences resulting from aggravated responsibility, namely: (a) the non-recognition
of the situation created by such breaches; (b) the prohibition of aid or assistance in
maintaining that situation; and (c) the exclusion of any immunities for the authors of
these breaches. Another consequence is that all States are required to invoke the
responsibility of the violator and to take measures against it, including by means of
sanctions, as well as criminal prosecutions and civil proceedings

====================

We look forward to a continued constructive dialogue with a view to identifying practical
steps that can be taken to ensure effective implementation of the responsibility to protect

in strict accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law

====================

I thank you.
