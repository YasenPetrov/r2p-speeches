Statement delivered by Rwanda – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2017
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]
Thank you Chair. Thank you Moderator

====================

From the outset, allow me to thank the president of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General for
considering this as an important subject for Member States to discuss. Rwanda aligns its statement to that
delivered by the Netherlands, on the behalf of the Group of Friends on the Responsibility to Protect

====================

Mr. Moderator we have a few points to make

====================

One, while, Mr. President the ninth report of the Secretary General takes stock of particular steps that can
be taken for prevention on genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing, we are
alarmed by the increasing number of atrocities being committed around the world and in conflict zones

====================

Therefore, Mr. Chair we believe that today more than ever before, upholding responsibility to protect and
preventing mass atrocities is of utmost importance to all of us. We also recognize important steps that have
been made at conceptual and normative level, but Mr. Chair let us also admit that the implementation of
2005 political commitment has been very inadequate in the face of the current crisis that the populations
around the world faces

====================

Mr. Chair,
Rwanda believes that adequate protection is about prevention of conflict in the first place. With establishing
clear warning and taking swift and decisive actions is to be considered at all times. International, regional,
and sub-regional organizations have an important role to play in this regard. They must develop their
capacities to streamline and implement their efforts to intervene when civilians are endangered, including
their ability to recognize and disseminate their signs of impending genocide. Additionally, Mr. Chair, the office
of the special advisor on prevention of genocide and the responsibility to protect must be empowered with
the required capacity and resources to fulfill their mandate, because through them we trust that – steps
positively can be taken forward in preventing atrocities. Chair, also, regional human rights systems and the
universal periodic reviews could also serve a better purpose if it was used

====================

Mr. Moderator,
We welcome the Secretary-General’s proposed planes, to put atrocity prevention at the heart of his overall
conflict prevention agenda, and protecting civilians in armed conflict and bringing an end to impunity. On
that note, Chair, we believe that conflict prevention at the national level is strengthened through
development of strong institutions that establish the foundations of good governance based on rule of law
and principal values

====================

Mr. Moderator,
To conclude, we look forward to the implementation of, not only, the recommendations in the secretarygenerals report, but also from this interactive discussion, including the consideration of R2P as a formal
agenda item by the General Assembly

====================

I thank you

====================
