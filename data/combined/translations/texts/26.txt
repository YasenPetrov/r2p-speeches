UNITED NATIONS
PRESS RELEASE
For immediate release
Statement by Adama Dieng, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide
on the situation in Hudaydah, Yemen
(New York, 14 June 2018) The United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide,
Adama Dieng, expressed grave concern at the potentially disastrous impact on civilians of the
military offensive against the port of Hudaydah, launched on 13 June by pro-government forces
backed by Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE), against Houthi fighters who have
been holding the port

====================

Yemen is currently considered to be the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with 10.4 million
people at risk of famine and Hudaydah is the entry point for seventy per cent of humanitarian
aid. In addition to the destruction that the offensive is likely to cause – and the risk to the
estimated 600,000 civilians who live in and around the port - closing the port for any length of
time could have a disastrous impact on the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver assistance
to a population that desperately needs it

====================

“Starvation of civilians as a method of war is a war crime and was condemned by the Security
Council in resolution 2417 of 24 May 2018. It seems that the first test of this resolution is
Yemen: the Yemeni port of Hudaydah is a lifeline for the delivery of aid and the Coalition’s air
strikes can kill many more people over time through famine and hunger when damaging such
civilian infrastructure.”
Special Adviser Dieng fully supports the call by the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for
Yemen, Martin Griffiths, for all parties to the conflict to exercise restraint and to find a political
solution to the conflict, stressing that there can be no military solution

====================

He called on the parties to uphold their obligations under international law in the conduct of
hostilities, in particular the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution. “Attacks
that are indiscriminate or directly target civilians or civilian objects may constitute war crimes

====================

All the parties to the conflict, as well as the international community, have a responsibility to
protect populations from atrocity crimes in Yemen.”
The Special Adviser called for accountability for alleged violations of international humanitarian
and human rights law committed during the conflict in Yemen
