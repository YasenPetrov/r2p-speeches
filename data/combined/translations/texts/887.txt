(spoke in
Spanish): It is an honour for Argentina to participate in
this debate, which represents a unique opportunity for
analysing the pending challenges to the international
community with regard to the responsibility to protect

====================

First of all, I would like to welcome the tenth report
of the Secretary-General (A/72/884), which stresses that
early action is central to the responsibility to protect

====================

As the report indicates, while there has been progress
in efforts to implement the responsibility to protect,
there is a growing gap between our responsibilities and
the daily experience of vulnerable populations. It is
noted that the main problem is the failure to translate
early warnings of atrocity crimes into effective early
action so as to prevent them

====================

Argentina shares the Secretary-General’s diagnosis
and believes that all States, as equal and sovereign,
have reciprocal rights and responsibilities, and all
should be equally committed to the protection of their
populations from atrocity crimes, through respect for

international law, especially humanitarian law, human
rights norms and refugee law, as well as the to the fight
against impunity

====================

In that context, Argentina considers that prevention
is the most important dimension in protecting
populations from atrocity crimes. That requires building
capacity in States by training public officials capable of
preventing the four crimes under the responsibility to
protect. It is also crucial to ensure the participation of
other actors such as civil society, since in many cases
they are the ones working in the field with States and
providing important technical assistance. The positive
role of regional and subregional organizations in
conflict prevention and resolution efforts should be
highlighted as well. We also consider it important to
increase our efforts to empower women as agents in the
prevention of atrocity crimes

====================

We believe it is essential to strengthen the
accountability of those responsible for atrocity crimes

====================

The ratification of the Rome Statute and its amendments
is key to protecting populations in the light of the
Statute’s contribution to the fight against impunity and
as a deterrent mechanism

====================

Also, on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary
of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of
the Crime of Genocide, we must reiterate the importance
of ratifying that effective international instrument for
accountability. We also invite all Member States to
endorse the Safe Schools Declaration, in support of
which my country had the honour to organize the second
international conference in Buenos Aires in 2017

====================

Argentina supports the initiatives of the United
Nations system, such as the responsibility to protect,
peacekeeping operations, peacebuilding actions, the
promotion of the rule of law and the Human Rights
Up Front initiative, among others. We would also like
to highlight the contribution of the Global Network
of R2P Focal Points, composed of 60 Member States,
including Argentina, as a tool for building individual
and collective capacities to prevent mass atrocities. I
want to express our support for the work of the Office
for the Prevention of Genocide and the Responsibility
to Protect and the crucial role played by both Special
Advisers in an area so relevant to our country

====================

In conclusion, Argentina would like to reiterate
the importance of reaffirming our commitment to the
responsibility to protect, redoubling our efforts towards
its full implementation and underscoring once again

the fundamental role of prevention and accountability
from a cross-cutting and comprehensive perspective in
all our efforts and initiatives.
