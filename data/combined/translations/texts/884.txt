At the outset, I would
like to thank the President of the General Assembly
for convening today’s meeting on the responsibility
to protect and the prevention of genocide, war crimes,
ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, as part
of the formal agenda of its seventy-second session

====================

Mauritius is already a party to the Rome Statute,
which we have introduced into our domestic legislation
in our International Criminal Court Act, which
criminalizes genocide and other atrocities of war
crimes. Through our support for the International
Criminal Court, we foster capabilities for accountability
and reconciliation, and we also do so to ensure
accountability for atrocity prevention and actively
promote the universality of the Rome Statute

====================

The debate on the subject is long overdue. The
last time the Assembly had a formal discussion on this
very important issue was in 2009. We commend Ghana
and Australia for encouraging a substantive discussion
among Member States on the responsibility to protect

====================

Today’s debate reflects the importance we attach to
this crucial subject and the consensus that has been
built over the past decade regarding the importance of
preventing atrocities

====================

This dialogue is a good opportunity for us to
collectively reflect on the principle of the responsibility
to protect, identify gaps and strengthen the mechanism
for making the responsibility to protect more effective

====================

Time is short and human rights and humanitarian
situations in many of the world’s hotspots are worsening,
while insecurity continues to grow. No longer should
we look back to atrocious crimes and genocide with the
feeling that too little was done too late. Too often in the
past we have said “Never again”. Yet grave allegations
of mass atrocities in various parts of the world, if
not addressed in a timely and effective manner, may
quickly spiral into catastrophes, human and otherwise

====================

We all acknowledge that it is the core function
of States to protect their citizens. As noted in this
year’s annual report of the Secretary-General on
“Responsibility to protect: from early warning to early
action” (A/72/884), the world simply must get better at
preventing and halting the most conscience-shocking
crimes. We welcome the focus on prevention, which is
about understanding the warning signs of an imminent
human catastrophe. It is important for all Member
States and the United Nations to take decisive action
to prevent and to protect people when clear signs exist

====================

On the African continent, the African Union and
other subregional organizations have been ahead of
the curve in establishing preventive mechanisms. They
should be supported in playing a more pronounced
role in preventing conflicts and sharpening their
early warning capabilities and their abilities. The

It is important that the international community
address the root causes of conflicts. In keeping
with our collective pledge under the Sustainable
Development Goals, which underscore that everyone
deserves a life of dignity, it is essential to promote
peaceful and inclusive societies, ensure justice for all
and build strong institutions for addressing conflicts

====================

For weak and vulnerable States, that can be achieved
only through technical assistance, capacity-building,
international partnerships and support

====================

The Acting President (spoke in French): We have
heard the last speaker in the debate on this item

====================

I shall now call on those representatives who have
asked to speak in exercise of the right of reply. I would
like to remind members that statements in the exercise
of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the
first statement and five minutes for the second, and
should be made by delegations from their seats.
