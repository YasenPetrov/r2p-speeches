Let me begin by
thanking the President through you, Sir, for convening
this important plenary meeting today, which marks the
third General Assembly debate on the responsibility to
protect (R2P). We align our statement with the statement
made this morning by the representative of Denmark on
behalf of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to
Protect (see A/73/PV.93). We welcome the appointment
of Ms. Karen Smith as Special Adviser on R2P and
appreciate the efforts of Mr. Adama Dieng, Special
Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide

====================

Bangladesh welcomes the inclusion of the
responsibility to protect and the prevention of genocide,
war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against

humanity on the formal agenda of the General Assembly
at its seventy-third session and support its inclusion as a
standing item on the General Assembly agenda

====================

the States that unwilling to live up to their commitment
to civilian protection. The plight of the Rohingya in
Myanmar is a case in point

====================

The discussions this morning were indicative of
the possible synergies and complementarities among
the United Nations humanitarian response, sustainable
development agenda, peacekeeping and sustaining
peace initiatives towards atrocity prevention. There
is evident scope for better utilizing the various
human rights institutional mechanisms for supporting
evidence-based risk assessment, early warning and
mitigation measures

====================

There is no denying that what has happened,
namely, the violence against Rohingya population, is
not new; neither was it a surprise. It is abundantly clear
that international crimes were committed in Myanmar

====================

Rohingya Muslims have been killed, tortured, raped,
burned alive and humiliated solely because of who
they are. The international community has been in
agreement that the targeted ethnic cleansing of the
Rohingya in fact took place. Indeed, the United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights labelled it as a
textbook example of ethnic cleansing

====================

As a troop-contributing country, Bangladesh
underscores the importance of clear and achievable
mandates for the protection of civilians by peacekeeping
missions and the provision of the corresponding
resources and capacity. We would like to report that
Bangladesh is participating in five of the eight current
United Nations missions that have a protection of
civilians mandate. We also maintain our in-principle
support for a possible suspension of the veto in the case
of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes
against humanity

====================

Bangladesh has always been supportive of the
Secretary-General’s clear-sighted approach to place
atrocity prevention as the centrepiece of his prevention
agenda, elaborated in his reports. We agree with the
Secretary-General that the Security Council should
collectively reflect on its role in atrocity prevention. We
also appreciate the suggested roles of the international
community that the Secretary-General has mentioned
in his 2019 report (A/73/898) on addressing hate
speech, providing support to national authorities in
strengthening their capacity to prevent atrocity crimes,
humanitarian action to help address the indirect effect
of atrocity crimes, engagement with religious leaders
and actors and providing support to local human
rights organizations and to women’s and youth groups,
et cetera

====================

There is a debate about whether it is possible to
effectively implement the principles of responsibility to
protect in view of the suffering of millions of people
from atrocity crimes. As we take stock of prevention
of atrocity crime since global leaders adopted this
principle in 2005, we have not seen much success in
prevention of genocides, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity. I would like to emphasize
that the failure of our R2P is not in its principles, but in

With the availability of technological and other
resources, early warning is rarely the problem

====================

However, United Nations mechanisms in Myanmar
could not provide early warning, as the problem
was even bigger. Surprisingly, it was not the lack of
warning, but the lack of a timely response that was the
problem. Very recently, we have come to know in detail
from the Rosenthal report why and where the United
Nations failed

====================

We strongly suggest that accountability for the
crimes that have been committed is necessary. I
urge the international community, in particular the
Security Council, to consider different accountability
options. The world needs to show that it is not ready
to tolerate such barbaric acts. Unfortunately, we
have not yet seen any determined commitment of the
international community to compel Myanmar to admit
its responsibility to protect populations from atrocity
crimes in Myanmar, nor have we seen any serious efforts
of countries that matter to come forward with support
as mentioned in Pillar Two of the R2P principles

====================

There has been a great deal of talk, as there always
is, condemning actions, making expectations clear,
expressing alarm, welcoming cooperation and so on

====================

We all know the Government of Myanmar failed in all
aspects. It failed to protect its own people. It failed to
implement fully the recommendations of the Rakhine
Advisory Commission’s road map. It failed to totally
cooperate at the bilateral level or with the international
community, the Special Rapporteur, the SecretaryGeneral’s Special Envoy and the United Nations
Independent International Fact-Finding Mission
on Myanmar

====================

On the other hand, we all collectively failed to
act in a timely and decisive manner. We helplessly
observed the Rohingya fleeing persecution and atrocity
crimes. Without the bold leadership demonstrated by
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina — also popularly known
as the Mother of Humanity for her generosity — these
persecuted people had nowhere to turn.. In this regard,
let me read from the report entitled “A Brief and
Independent Inquiry into the Involvement of the United
Nations in Myanmar from 2010 to 2018” by Mr. Gert
Rosenthal, which has been shared with the Assembly:
“It must also be said that the collective membership
of the United Nations, represented by the Security
Council, bears part of that responsibility, by not
providing enough support to the Secretariat when
such backing was and continues to be essential. If
there is one single action that might have altered
the course of events in Myanmar it would have
been the timely and impartial presence in Rakhine
state of some type of United Nations observatory
that would offer a measure of confidence to the
oppressed minorities that their basic human rights
would be respected, and that the root causes that
led to their forced emigration would be addressed
by the national authorities.”
Despite our failure to prevent atrocities in Myanmar,
we firmly believe that we still have the opportunity
to compensate. Moving forward, the international
community, led by the United Nations, while needing to
recommit to its goals of atrocity prevention, may look
into the possibility of exploring the remaining options
in pillar III of the R2P principles

====================

Let me reaffirm our commitment in this Hall and
before the Assembly that despite clear and visible
social and economic constraints and the environmental
impact that the influx of Rohingya has been placing
on the Cox’s Bazar area and the host communities in
Bangladesh, we will continue to protect and support
them until their voluntary, safe, dignified and
sustainable return to Myanmar. We must not fail the
Rohingya population. The solution to this problem lies
first and foremost in the Myanmar authorities, who will
have to resolve it by creating conditions conducive for
the Rohingya population to return home in safety

====================

The international community also has a
responsibility to protect this population from the risk
of further atrocity crimes. Under present conditions,
returning to Myanmar will put the Rohingya population

at risk of further crimes. However, accepting the current
status quo would be a victory for those who planned
and carried out the attacks in the first place. We must
not accept either of these scenarios.
