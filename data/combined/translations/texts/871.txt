(spoke in French): First of
all, I would like to thank the President for organizing
this formal debate of the General Assembly on the
responsibility to protect, the third since 2009. Indeed,
the inclusion of the responsibility to protect on the
official agenda of the United Nations over the past two
years reflects the strong interest of Member States in
sharing ideas and good practices in this area, including
the collective power to improve the international
community’s capacity to prevent genocide, war crimes,
crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing

====================

My delegation takes note of the latest report of the
Secretary-General (A/73/898), entitled “Responsibility
to protect: lessons learned for prevention”, which pays
particular attention to prevention and early warning
and action, and recognizes that the responsibility to
protect is a key element of this important process

====================

It is clear that the international community has
come a long way in the field of protection, both in terms
of peacekeeping, respect for and promotion of human
rights, democracy and the rule of law, and in terms of
preventing atrocities. Accordingly, this debate offers
Member States an important opportunity to share their
experiences, good practices and effective strategies
to prevent atrocities. In addition, it is important to
reiterate that the responsibility to protect involves the
State and its institutions. The various components of
society must have a code of ethics aimed at promoting
tolerance and coexistence and promoting intercultural
and interreligious dialogue. Allow me to point out
that nearly one third of Member States, including the
Kingdom of Morocco, have appointed a national focal
point on the responsibility to protect, making this global
network the largest governmental network dedicated to
the prevention of mass atrocities

====================

I would now like to express my delegation’s
view on the following points. First, we recall the
intersecting relationship between the three pillars of
the responsibility to protect and reiterate that the third
is primarily the responsibility of States. Nevertheless,
it must be noted that in times of conflict, the capacities
of these States may be insufficient or even non-existent

====================

In these cases, the international community can support
them by building their capacities by providing them with

the necessary means to protect their own populations

====================

This can be achieved, in particular, by strengthening
legal instruments and consolidating democracy and the
rule of law. Capacity-building for technical assistance
is indeed an important preventive measure

====================

Secondly, States are required to fulfil their
obligations to combat impunity, as well as to conduct
full investigations and prosecute anyone responsible
for mass atrocity crimes in order to prevent their
recurrence. In this sense, national accountability
efforts must be encouraged and supported, in particular
by strengthening judicial cooperation among States

====================

Thirdly, we encourage the various United Nations
bodies to make better use of the instruments at their
disposal, to act in a timely and decisive manner to
prevent mass atrocities and strengthen international
accountability. Important mechanisms such as the
Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review
(UPR) are well placed to support prevention efforts

====================

We encourage Member States to make better use of the
UPR process as a preventive mechanism

====================

Finally, we believe that it would be desirable
to favour a preventive approach in order to assess

threats and coordinate actions while avoiding any
degradation of the situation in question. The preventive
dimension can be developed through capacity-building
in the countries concerned, respect for the rule of law,
ensuring good governance, entrenching the culture of
human rights and setting up early-warning mechanisms
to detect pre-conflict situations and avoid their
transformation into open and deadly confrontations

====================

In conclusion, the Kingdom of Morocco shares
the Secretary-General’s firm conviction that the
responsibility to protect necessarily implies the
strengthening of democracy and the rule of law as well
as the implementation of provisions of international
humanitarian law and human rights law. Morocco
supports the Secretary-General in his efforts aimed
at promoting peace, security, conflict prevention and
the peaceful settlement of disputes, as well as the
development and respect for human rights.
