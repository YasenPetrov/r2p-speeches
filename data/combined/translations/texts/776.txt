(spoke in French): France
thanks the President of the General Assembly for
organizing today’s debate and the Secretary-General
for his report on the responsibility to protect (A/72/884)
and, above all, for his personal commitment to the
issue. I would also like to thank the Special Adviser on
the Prevention of Genocide, Mr. Adama Dieng, whose
work and dedication I commend

====================

The concept of the responsibility to protect
was endorsed in 2005 by all States members of the
General Assembly so that States would never again
commit atrocities against their own citizens. Yet as the
Secretary-General has pointed out, despite the fact that
we will be commemorating the seventieth anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on
10 December, the most serious crimes are unfortunately
far from being on the decline around the world, whether
in Syria, Burma, South Sudan or the Central African
Republic, to cite some striking examples. Working
together, we must — and we can — do more to protect
the most vulnerable

====================

Despite the solemn commitments we have jointly
made, tragic situations that the United Nations is
powerless to address continue to prevail. We all are
thinking here, of course, of the situation in Syria

====================

Over the past seven years, the Syrian regime has
committed numerous crimes against its own people,
including through the use of chemical weapons,
and has consistently violated its obligations under
international law, primarily in humanitarian matters

====================

This is an incontrovertible fact that has been repeatedly
established by robust and impartial mechanisms that

form part of our collective security architecture

====================

However, the United Nations has been prevented from
acting effectively because of Russia’s 12 vetoes in the
Security Council

====================

France is not resigned to that situation. On the
contrary, we call on those who have influence over the
Syrian regime to assume their responsibilities. It is in
that spirit that France, through its highest authorities,
has engaged Russia and Iran in recent months,
pragmatically and in accordance with principles of
international law, so that urgent concrete measures can
be taken on the ground to end the suffering of the men,
women and children of Syria. That is the primary goal
of the Small Group of the Global Coalition to Counter
the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham, of which France
is part, which is meeting today in Geneva with Staffan
de Mistura, the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria

====================

Another tragic situation that shocks the conscience
is that of the Rohingya. More than 720,000 have fled
Burma to Bangladesh since the end of August 2017

====================

France reiterates its condemnation of the serious human
rights violations committed against the Rohingya
people. The Security Council has visited the area, and
the measures taken by the Burmese authorities are a
first step, but the commitments have yet to be translated
into action. Much progress remains to be made. It is
therefore essential to ensure that the international
community, especially through the Security Council,
remains vigilant and mobilized

====================

It is up to every State to protect its own peoples

====================

If States fail to do so, however, it is the responsibility
of the international community, represented by our
Organization and within it the Security Council, to
work tirelessly to that end. Considering the magnitude
of the challenges, the Council must be able to respond,
especially in situations of mass atrocities. In that
regard, France and Mexico have proposed a concrete
measure — suspending the use of the veto in the event
of mass atrocities. We invite all States, especially the
other four permanent members of the Council, to join
that initiative

====================

We also have a responsibility to support the fight
against impunity and to support independent and
impartial justice. With the support of France and other
partners, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic
supports the operationalization of the Special Criminal
Court, which has competence in serious violations of

human rights and international humanitarian law, as
well as other abuses that may constitute war crimes,
crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity

====================

France calls on all States to support and cooperate
with fact-finding missions, commissions of inquiry and
international criminal justice instruments — first and
foremost of which is the International Criminal Court,
in the case of the most serious crimes. We must remain
vigilant against those who spread ethnic and religious
hatred and violence, which the Security Council still
has the means to sanction.
