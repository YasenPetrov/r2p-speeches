Group of Friends of R2P Geneva
Statement during the Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on
violence against women
27 June 2019
Mr. President,
I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of members of the Group of Friends of
the Responsibility to Protect

====================

We would like to thank the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and
consequences for her tireless efforts to recommend measures, ways and means at the local,
national, regional and international levels to eliminate all forms of violence against women,
as this constitutes a violation of their human rights and fundamental freedoms

====================

We note with appreciation the Special Rapporteur’s focus on the challenges of her mandate
since its inception, and in particular the link between her mandate and other mechanisms. We
concur with the Special Rapporteur that concerted efforts are needed to bridge the gap between
mechanisms with specific focus on violence against women to avoid fragmentation that is
demonstrated in her report

====================

To concur with the Special Rapporteur’s recommendation on establishing a system-wide
approach to address violence against women, the Group of Friends of R2P has continuously
emphasized the link between the Responsibility to Protect and Geneva-based human rights
mechanisms and institutions to address atrocities, including sexual violence. As the primary
international human rights body, the Human Rights Council, through its procedures and
mechanisms, is particularly well suited to apply preventive measures in situations where early
warning signs of possible atrocities arise

====================

In this context, we believe that extreme structural and institutionalized forms of gender
inequality and targeted violence against women may constitute potential risk factors for mass
atrocities or even constitute these crimes in itself. To follow the Special Rapporteur’s important
initiative to cooperate with the Committee on CEDAW to ensure better coherence on shared
issues between the mechanisms., we are of the view that the same intrinsic link between the
mandate and the Committee applies to the Women, Peace and Security agenda and the
Responsibility to Protect as well

====================

Geneva-based human rights mechanisms, in this respect, can play a vital role in strengthening
gender-specific assessment of human rights violations. In addition, through applying a gender
lens to technical assistance and capacity-building measures, the Human Rights Council can
play a key role in supporting governments to uphold R2P and overcome the lack of gendersensitivity in atrocity prevention, thereby furthering the broader sexual violence prevention
agenda

====================

Other human rights mechanisms, including HRC-mandated Fact-Finding Missions and
Commissions of Inquiry, provide further opportunities for a systematic integration of gendersensitive protection measures and to strengthen the role of women. Women need to be
included in these mechanisms and to lead them. Utilizing the knowledge of female experts and
conducting gender-sensitive investigations can ensure that women’s perspectives and needs
are discussed. Enhancing the focus on the transformation of women’s role in society can
positively contribute to the efficiency of post-conflict and accountability strategies. This will in
turn help preventing the commission of atrocity crimes

====================

Lastly, it is crucial to recognize that women around the world have always played an essential
role in developing mitigation strategies on an individual, family and community level. In
today’s atrocity situations, women are often times key actors in ininitiatives and efforts to
prevent or respond to atrocities and violence, leading to a tremendous impact on human rights

protection within their communities. It is therefore important that they have our support and
protection

====================

Security Council resolution 2467 on Women, Peace and Security recognizes that sexual
violence in conflict occurs on a continuum of interrelated and recurring forms of violence
against women and girls. We would like to ask the Special Rapporteur; in your view, what
opportunities do you see in aligning the WPS and R2P agendas to prevent and respond to
sexual violence in conflict? Are we adequately exploring the benefits of gender-responsive
engagement in atrocity prevention and/or accountability processes? And if not, how can we
encourage and develop it?
Thank you
