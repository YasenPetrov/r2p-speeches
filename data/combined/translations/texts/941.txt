(spoke in French): Canada
thanks the President of the General Assembly and the
Chef de Cabinet to the Secretary-General for their
statements (see A/73/PV.93), as well as Denmark and
Qatar for their leadership of the Group of Friends of the
Responsibility to Protect

====================

The responsibility to protect (R2P) is a disarmingly
simple idea. It advocates that sovereign States have a
responsibility to protect their own populations from
four crimes that shock the conscience of humankind:
genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and
ethnic cleansing. R2P draws a red line when it comes to
atrocity crimes. Today R2P is about prevention. To that
end, Canada would like to see the Office on Genocide
Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect formally
mandated to submit an annual report on R2P

====================

The report of the independent international factfinding mission on Myanmar highlights the existence
of serious human rights violations, including gang rape
and sexual slavery. We have repeatedly called for an
immediate end to violence and persecution in Myanmar

and for those responsible to be held accountable. The
prevention of future atrocity crimes can be meaningful
only if the ongoing mass atrocity crimes are addressed
first. Accountability is an important tool to that end

====================

That is why Canada’s foreign policy priorities include
revitalizing the rules-based international order and
reaffirming its support for international institutions,
such as the International Criminal Court (ICC). We
continue to advocate for a Security Council referral of
Myanmar to the ICC

====================

(spoke in English)
Canada welcomes the recent appointment of a
new Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect,
Ms. Karen Smith of South Africa. The work of the
Special Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide and on
the Responsibility to Protect to mainstream R2P within
the United Nations system is fundamental in order to
prevent mass atrocity crimes

====================

That is why Canada calls for enhancing risk
analysis and early-warning mechanisms that include
a strong gender lens, but also regular briefings to the
Security Council by the United Nations Special Adviser
on the Prevention of Genocide, the United Nations
Special Adviser on R2P and the High Commissioner
for Human Rights

====================

Canada further encourages Security Council
members to better utilize the Council’s working
methods to bring potential mass atrocity situations
for consideration as early as possible. Situational
awareness briefings and the Arria Formula mechanism
must be further used to better incorporate mass atrocity
prevention into the Security Council agenda

====================

We know that women and girls are targeted and
experience violence differently from men and boys

====================

They often bear the brunt of the economic and social
consequences of atrocities. Discrimination against
women and girls and other human rights violations
are meaningful indicators of the potential for atrocity
crimes. Sexual and gender-based violence in conflict
settings can be a constituent element of an act of
genocide, a war crime, a crime against humanity or
ethnic cleansing. As such, the protection of those
at risk of sexual and gender-based violence is also a
fundamental responsibility for all States as part of their
commitment to R2P

====================

Going forward, R2P advocates need to embrace the
struggle against gender discrimination and inequality

on its own terms. Together, we should recognize the
multiple roles of women and girls in the context of
genocide and mass atrocities as victims, bystanders,
perpetrators, protectors and peacemakers. R2P can
achieve its objectives only when the United Nations
goals in advancing women and peace and security,
and in ending gender discrimination more broadly,
are achieved.
