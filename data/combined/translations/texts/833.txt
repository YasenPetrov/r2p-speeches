Slovenia strongly
welcomes today’s General Assembly formal debate on
the responsibility to protect, the first of its kind since
2009. We would like to thank the Secretary-General for
his report this year (A/72/884)

====================

Slovenia aligns itself with the statements delivered
earlier by the observer of the European Union and by

the representative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of
Friends of the Responsibility to Protect

====================

Slovenia has been a strong supporter of the
principle of the responsibility to protect from the very
start. Today we want to once again express our full and
continuing support for the principle and for the work
of the Secretary-General and his Special Advisers

====================

We welcome their efforts to improve the system-wide
capacity of the United Nations to prevent and respond
to serious violations of human rights and international
humanitarian law, especially those that may amount to
mass atrocity crimes

====================

Today’s formal debate, and the inclusion of
the responsibility to protect and the prevention of
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity on the General Assembly’s agenda at
its seventy-second session, could not be more timely,
since this is the year we celebrate the seventieth
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and of the Convention on the Prevention and
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. We join other
States in thanking Ghana and Australia for their strong
leadership in including the responsibility to protect
on the Assembly’s agenda. We support that and would
welcome the inclusion of the responsibility to protect as
a standing agenda item of the General Assembly

====================

In 2005 the global community decided that more
had to be done to strengthen our joint efforts to prevent
atrocity crimes and protect all populations from
ever being their victims. The latest report, however,
once again reminds us of a hard reality. We are still
looking at images of armed conflicts and acts of
violent extremism and with widespread and systematic
violations of human rights, international humanitarian
law and the rule of law in general

====================

Slovenia reiterates here today that no effort should
be spared to systematically invest in the prevention
of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity. Slovenia organized and hosted
several regional meetings and academic conferences
on the responsibility to protect in 2013, 2015 and 2017
with various stakeholders from Europe, as well as
other regions. Valuable knowledge, good practices and
experiences were shared among participants, leading
to the endorsement of the Chair’s statement regarding
the responsibility to protect and the prevention of mass
atrocity crimes during the third meeting of European
responsibility-to-protect focal points. in 2017

====================

Time and again at the United Nations we have
heard strong calls to improve the international
community’s ability to take timely and decisive early
action. While we recognize the primary role of the
Security Council in the maintenance of international
peace and security, a great deal can be done by Member
States, the Secretariat and the wider United Nations
system. We therefore strongly support the efforts of
the Secretary-General to improve the system-wide
capacity of the United Nations to prevent and respond
to serious and systemic violations of human rights law
and international humanitarian law. In that context, we
once again stress the importance of the Human Rights
Up Front initiative as an important tool for improving
alertness and effectiveness early on. We also encourage
the use of every other tool available, including the
Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes

====================

Slovenia firmly supports the code of conduct
developed by the Accountability, Coherence and
Transparency group, and the French-Mexican initiative,
which calls on the permanent members of the Security
Council to agree to voluntarily refrain from using the
veto in situations of genocide, war crimes and crimes
against humanity. We also see value in regular briefings
of the Security Council by the High Commissioner for
Human Rights, as well as by the Special Advisers to the
Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide and
the Responsibility to Protect. Geneva-based institutions
and mechanisms such as the Universal Periodic Review
and special procedures mandate holders can play a role
in increasing early awareness and early-action efforts

====================

Slovenia once again affirms its strong commitment
to remaining an advocate of the responsibility to protect
and the wider promotion and protection of human rights

====================

We will continue to contribute in the advancement of
human rights in international human rights forums, as
well as in our role as an active member of the Human
Rights Council

====================

A crucial aspect in preventing the recurrence
of conflicts is ensuring accountability for all
responsibility-to-protect crimes and other serious
abuses of human rights and international humanitarian
law. Slovenia remains a strong supporter of the
International Criminal Court, as well as regional and
State mechanisms for countering impunity. For the past
20 years, the Rome Statute has offered an important
legal framework in this context and has acted as a
deterrent to the most heinous crimes. Slovenia will

continue to advocate for the universality of the Rome
Statute, including the Kampala amendments

====================

We, the Member States, have the primary
responsibility to protect our populations from
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity. It is our responsibility to meet our
obligations under international law and to condemn
any actions that go against the norms and principles
that safeguard humankind. But as we have said many
times during informal dialogues in previous years, the
obligations go beyond that. Differing views on how to
achieve that, many of which we will hear today in this
Hall, must not inhibit our joint determination and our
commitment to protecting populations in the future
from crimes related to the responsibility to protect

====================

Coordinated action and preventive measures require
closer and stronger links among nations. We therefore
welcome the growing network of responsibility-toprotect focal points and encourage all States to join

====================

In conclusion, we would also like to recognize the
contributions of the previous Special Advisers on the
Responsibility to Protect, and we are looking forward
to the appointment of the next. Once again, we reaffirm
Slovenia’s support for the United Nations Office on
Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect.
