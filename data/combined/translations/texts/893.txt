(spoke in
Russian): I will begin my statement in a less than
traditional way, with some words of regret. We regret
the fact that, for the second year in a row, debates on this
issue have been moved to the General Assembly through
a vote. The interactive dialogue format that prevailed
prior to 2018 has been relegated to the past, and with it
opportunities to discuss and reconcile positions. There
was a time when the older United Nations elites would
say that if you want to make an idea boring, drown it in

the routine of national statements; if you want to kill an
idea, refuse all compromise and put it to a vote. We see
a similar situation here with the unfortunate concept of
the responsibility to protect (R2P)

====================

We note the most recent report of the SecretaryGeneral (A/73/898) on this topic. Like previous
reports, we view it strictly through the lens of the
relevant chapter of the 2005 World Summit Outcome
document. We share the general view on the need to
prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and
crimes against humanity, which runs throughout the
Secretary-General’s report. That is the right idea. It
was first proposed by States in the 2005 World Summit
Outcome document. However, over time the idea has
been interpreted in too many different ways. Today the
substance of the concept of R2P has been degraded

====================

We regret the fact that the Secretary-General’s report
does not reflect the full spectrum of approaches taken

====================

We are guided by the fact that reports must include a
description of the current status of discussions on the
concept, a list of all perspectives and, crucially, all
contentious elements on which States must agree

====================

I had planned to end my statement here, but I am
unable to do so. Just before I spoke, the representative of
Ukraine took the floor and again levelled accusations at
my country, with his hackneyed theories of occupation,
aggression and other crimes and mortal sins. It must be
understood that this is a country that includes among
the ranks of its national heroes Nazi cronies such as and
Roman Shukhevych and Stepan Bandera; where every
year a torch-bearing ceremony is held similar to the
one in Nazi Germany in 1939; and where soldiers draw
swastikas on their helmets. It is a country whose former
President took photographs of himself with his soldiers
in the background bearing symbols of Schutzstaffel
squadrons. It is country that burned its own citizens
and, during a talk show, those events were applauded by
Ukrainians in an auditorium. As such, this country has
no right to level accusations at the Russian Federation

====================

Regrettably, Ukraine now needs at least three things:
denazification, demilitarization and democratization. It
needs real democratization, and not just colourful gay
parades in the central squares of Kyiv.
