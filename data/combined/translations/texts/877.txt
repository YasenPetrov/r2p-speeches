My delegation would like to
thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive 2018
report (A/72/884), entitled “Responsibility to protect:
from early warning to early action”, concentrating on
how to better prevent atrocity crimes

====================

Thirteen years have passed since the adoption
of the 2005 World Summit Outcome document on
the concept of the responsibility to protect. Despite
intensive interactive debates among Member States on
the issue for more than a decade, we have not been able
to reach a consensus on how to translate the concept
into practice. While recognizing the importance of the
prevention of atrocity crimes, I would like to emphasize
once again that it is the primary responsibility of
States to protect their citizens. The international
community can provide assistance to Governments in
their national efforts to undertake their responsibilities
through capacity-building. Preventive measures should
employ the peaceful means of dialogue, negotiations,
confidence-building and reconciliation. Interfaith
dialogues and the promotion of religious harmony
among different faiths can also contribute significantly
to peace and stability among different communities and
effectively prevent tension and violent confrontation

====================

In that respect, countries should develop the
policies and mechanisms best suited to their own
situations in order to prevent conflict and ensure the
peaceful settlement of disputes. National ownership

must be ensured for preventing crimes related to the
responsibility to protect. With regard to international
involvement in the responsibility to protect, respect
for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of
States, as well as the principles of the Charter of the
United Nations, must be strictly upheld. My delegation
would like to stress that judging or categorizing a
situation as a specific mass atrocity, or deciding to
invoke the responsibility to protect, must be done based
on well-founded, unbiased and factual information,
with impartiality, accuracy and objectivity. In that
connection, we are concerned about the existential
danger presented by the misuse or abuse of the principles
of the responsibility to protect by some groups and
countries for their political agenda. My delegation
categorically rejects the unsubstantiated accusations
about the recent humanitarian situation in Rakhine
state and its labelling as amounting to atrocity crimes

====================

With regard to accountability, my delegation
concurs that States have the primary responsibility to
investigate and prosecute crimes committed within their
jurisdiction. As a State party to the Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,
the Government of Myanmar has a clear position,
which is that it will not condone any abuse of human
rights. When concrete evidence exists, we are ready to
take action against the transgressors, regardless of their
identity, in accordance with the law. In that regard, the
Government recently announced its decision to form
an independent commission of inquiry, together with
an international member, to investigate human rights
violations following the Arakan Rohingya Salvation
Army’s terrorist attacks on 30 security outposts in
Rakhine state in August 2017

====================

We are also concerned about the politicization
and abuse of the International Criminal Court beyond
its jurisdiction. Such actions can only jeopardize the
legitimacy and integrity of the Court

====================

My delegation strongly objects to the inclusion of
my country, Myanmar, under the subheading entitled
“Forced displacement and refugee crisis” in the points
for consideration at this meeting, as a country in which
atrocity crimes have allegedly taken place. Such a
prejudicial judgment, based on unfounded allegations
and continuing media bias, will not contribute to the
objective and constructive elaboration of the matter
under discussion

====================

Since there remains a wide range of differences on
the understanding and interpretation of this complex
concept, we should continue the present method of
interactive dialogue with a view to achieving consensus
on the part of all Member States on translating the
concept of the responsibility to protect into action in
accordance with the 2005 World Summit Outcome
document and resolution 63/308. We should point out
that a vote was needed to adopt a recommendation to
include this item in the formal agenda of the General
Assembly (see A/72/PV.2), which showed a clear lack
of consensus. We have been witnesses to the fact that
the manipulation of the concept of the responsibility
to protect, along with hypocrisy and the application of
double standards, has led to catastrophic consequences

====================

We should first focus on strengthening States’ capacity
and institutions for protecting their populations from
atrocity crimes and on constructive engagement with
those States, including by using diplomatic approaches
and providing practical support

====================

In conclusion, my delegation therefore does not
support the inclusion of the responsibility to protect
and the prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity as a standing
item on the General Assembly agenda or in the further
pursuit of a resolution in that regard.
