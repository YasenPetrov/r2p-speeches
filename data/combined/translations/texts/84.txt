Informal Interactive Dialogue of the UNGA on R2P

Thank you first to the Permanent Missions of Australia and
Ghana for leading on this important issue. The United States
has participated in these important dialogues since their
inception and we are glad to join in today to reaffirm our
enduring commitment to preventing atrocities, including
genocide

====================

We very much welcome the issuance of Secretary-General
Guterres’s first report on the subject of Responsibility to
Protect and were pleased with his call to action for States to
do more to prevent atrocities. His report included many
critical recommendations that member states can consider
implementing to protect their own populations from
atrocities, as well as steps we all can consider taking to
further our commitment to the collective responsibility to
protect, in appropriate circumstances

====================

The United States has undertaken internal steps to build a
robust atrocity prevention policymaking apparatus, which
has developed prevention policies. These policies have
resulted in specific actions, including deployment of UN
monitoring and reporting mechanisms, strategic diplomatic
engagement, sanctions, the recalibration or termination of
foreign assistance, among numerous others

====================

We have done this together with partner countries who share
our commitment to atrocity prevention. The United States
remains committed to this model and we will continue
refining and developing it. We will continue to work, as well,
through multilateral fora, including the United Nations
General Assembly, the Security Council, the Group of
Friends of the Responsibility to Protect, and close
partnerships we have developed with likeminded countries
on atrocity prevention

====================

Over the coming weeks and months, we will continue to
examine the Secretary-General’s recommendations and
explore ways in which we can further work toward atrocity
prevention as a core policy priority. We welcome the
Secretary-General, in this regard, noting that he intends to
maintain this issue at the core of his work and we look
forward to learning where he situates the critical roles of his
Special Advisor on Responsibility to Protect and his Special
Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide – both essential
functions to UN policy
