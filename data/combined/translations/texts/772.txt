(spoke in French):
Switzerland welcomes the inclusion of this important
debate on the responsibility to protect on the agenda
of the seventy-second session of the General Assembly

====================

Genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes
are the most serious crimes under public international
law, which obliges all States — whether or not they
are directly party to a conflict — to take all necessary
measures to prevent such crimes, end those under way,
bring their perpetrators to justice and prevent their
recurrence. As we celebrate the twentieth anniversary
of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal
Court, it is fitting to recall the fundamental role played
by this institution in the fight against impunity. We
encourage all States to cooperate with the Court and
support it so that it can continue to fulfil its vital role in
the prevention of serious crimes

====================

We commemorated World Refugee Day only a
few days ago. To grasp the gravity of the situation,
one has only to look at the unprecedented number of
68.5 million displaced persons throughout the world,
the great majority of whom have been displaced
owing to conflict. Discussions on the responsibility
to protect continue to be essential, and the debate on
this issue should be set up within an institutionalized

framework and take place on a regular basis. With
regard to such institutionalized frameworks, we
underscore the importance of the United Nations
Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility
to Protect and its Special Advisers, whose cooperation
has been invaluable to Switzerland in the context of its
commitment to the prevention of atrocities, not only
in the framework of the Global Action against Mass
Atrocity Crimes but in others as well

====================

Switzerland is convinced that effective prevention
requires addressing the root causes of conflicts

====================

In that regard, we especially welcome the process
of reflection on the system of protection of human
rights, in particular on the role of the Human Rights
Council. We call on all States to cooperate with that
essential body. More attention needs to be given to the
preventive potential of the Human Rights Council, and
together with a group of States we therefore introduced
a draft resolution during the current session under
way in Geneva. Moreover, the three pillars of the
United Nations must be brought closer together so that
real progress can be made in preventing violence and
human suffering, which dovetails with the prevention
vision that the Secretary-General has elaborated on
many times

====================

The goal of moving from early warning to early
action can be achieved only if the Security Council
more frequently and effectively avails itself of the
preventive role that the Charter of the United Nations
confers on it. In that context, the Council should make
greater use of the potential offered by existing formal
and informal mechanisms

====================

In conclusion, Switzerland would also like to
point to the vital role that civil society can play in the
prevention of atrocities, not only as a voice condemning
violations but as an entity possessing expertise in a
specific area that has not yet been fully developed or
implemented at the national level.
