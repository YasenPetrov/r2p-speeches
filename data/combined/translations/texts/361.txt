Thank you, Mr. President,
1. We would like to thank the President of the General Assembly and the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations for their opening statements. We also appreciate the
statements made by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations and the other
panelists. We would like to especially express our recognition to the Special Adviser of
the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, Mr. Adama Dieng, and to the
Special Adviser of the Secretary-General for the Responsibility to Protect, Ms. Jennifer
Welsh, as well as to their Office for its continued efforts in alerting Member States of the
threats and potential risks of atrocity crimes and its work in the preparation of this report

====================

Spain participated in the consultative process launched by the Office, an exercise we
especially welcome

====================

2. My country fully aligns with the statement delivered by the Delegation of the European
Union and wishes to make the following contributions in our national capacity

====================

3. Spain firmly supports the full and effective implementation of the Responsibility to
Protect (R2P). The 2005 World Summit Outcome Document, adopted by the Heads of
State and Government of all UN Member States, established our collective responsibility
to encourage and assist States to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes,
ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, including assistance to States that are in
situations of stress before crises and conflicts erupt

====================

4. The atrocities perpetrated in Rwanda and Bosnia Herzegovina, and most recently in
Central African Republic, South Sudan and Iraq, must be the driving force behind our
firm will to work towards preventing such crimes from being committed and towards
developing an effective strategy on prevention

====================

5. Therefore, we welcome this report, which contains a useful and valuable analysis of the
ways international actors could encourage and assist States to effectively prevent
atrocity crimes, under the Responsibility to Protect Pillar II. We believe that the
preventive approach is a wise and effective investment in the long term, thus avoiding
the much greater cost of taking action once the crisis has erupted as well as the
devastation that occurs. It is crucial that early warning translates into early action

====================

6. We consider especially interesting the difference made in the report between A)
measures to encourage States to comply with its Responsibility to Protect; B) ways to
support capacities which allow States to be more resilient in the face of atrocity crimes;
as well as C) direct assistance which complements the protection capacities of States in
situations of crisis

====================

7. First and foremost, human rights constitute an international obligation of States, and
their violation concerns the international community as a whole. This is the main tool
international actors have to encourage a State to comply its Responsibility to Protect. It
includes reports by Human Rights Treaty Bodies; visits by Special Mandates; and the
Peer Review Process within the framework of the Universal Periodic Review, which can
be especially effective when it takes place among States in the same region. Through
these instruments and others also reflected in the report, such as preventive diplomacy,
good offices, and political dialogue, be it public or confidential, the international
community could remind States of their obligations under International Human Rights
Law and International Humanitarian Law, as well as the serious risks of non-compliance
of these obligations assumed by every State with the international community

====================

8. We consider especially valuable and interesting the analysis of the ways in which
international assistance could help States to develop capacities allowing them to better
address the structural causes and the risk factors that could lead to crisis and conflicts,
thereby building societies resilient to atrocity crimes. Frequently, atrocity crimes occur in
situations characterized by deeply rooted economic and social inequalities; conflicts
regarding access to resources; as well as discrimination, marginalization and exclusion
of certain groups. In this context, it is vital to develop solid, cohesive and inclusive
structures of democratic governance, capable of managing diversity in a constructive
manner Rule of Law must be strengthened and state institutions must be viewed by
citizens as legitimate, effective and responsible

====================

9. International actors could assist States in integrating R2P into their own institutional
building on the basis of a human approach that addresses issues such as the full
exercise of rights, an equitable participation in the country’s wealth and resources, the
reduction of inequalities and the attention to vulnerable groups

====================

10. The assessment of the MDG Achievement Fund (established by Spain in partnership
with the UNDP), identified some lessons learned in the sector of Conflict Prevention and
Peace consolidation, which could help to create a favorable scenario for the prevention
of violence. Actions directed towards encouraging trust and inter-communal ties,
through dialogue and platforms bringing together local and national actors, are
especially important. Also crucial are measures geared towards ensuring that all
citizens, in particular, minority groups and vulnerable populations, know and exercise
their rights; as well as measures aimed at increasing knowledge of and respect towards
cultural, ethnic or religious differences

====================

11. We value the reference made to the principle of national ownership. International
assistance must align itself with the needs, priorities and solutions that are identified by
local and national actors. They are to lead the process. In this respect, participation of
civil society, especially women, is vital. Equally important is the principle “do no harm”

====================

External assistance must avoid involuntarily creating or strengthening conditions that
favour conflict, such as inequalities, discrimination or marginalization of certain groups

====================

In this regard, international assistance must be sufficiently flexible as to quickly respond
and adapt to the changing circumstances and must be guided by a long-term approach

====================

We also consider particularly accurate the reflection on the necessary coherence,
coordination and complementarity among the efforts of the different international actors

====================

12. We consider useful and valuable the concept of specific “inhibitors” which allow States
to mitigate potential risk factors and to respond to early signs of crisis that could turn to

violence. In this sense, we attribute special importance to the support to security sector
reform; the strengthening of electoral institutions; the establishment of an independent,
impartial and accessible legal system; and the development of human rights institutions

====================

Especially, we highlight the importance of local capacity building in mediation, an area in
which Spain has an active role, through its support to the Mediation Support Team of
the UN Department of Political Affairs and within the framework of the Initiative on
Mediation in the Mediterranean Region, launched by Spain and Morocco

====================

13. But in spite of these efforts, certain situations may require direct international assistance
to complement the capacities of States to protect their population. In these cases, in
addition to mediation efforts by certain international actors who hold the trust of the
parties to the conflict, it is important to mention the important role of Peacekeeping
Operations and Special Political Missions, as well as the Peacebuilding Commission

====================

Many atrocity crimes take place in the context of armed conflict, which frequently follow
a cyclical pattern. In these situations, peace consolidation efforts by Peacekeeping
Operations, Special Political Missions and the PBC could effectively contribute to the
prevention of atrocity crimes

====================

Mr. President,
14. 2015 will mark the tenth anniversary of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document

====================

This will certainly be an excellent opportunity to assess the efforts undergone to
effectively implement R2P up to the present, as well as to renew and deepen our
collective commitment with R2P in the years ahead. We support that the General
Assembly plays an active role in this issue

====================

15. We call upon the Member States, international organizations and other actors to
incorporate an R2P lens to all of its actions. In this sense, we welcome the SecretaryGeneral’s initiative “Rights Up Front”, a way to mainstream the efforts aimed at
preventing Human Rights violations, including atrocity crimes, within the work of the
United Nations system. We encourage the Member States that have not yet done so to
designate a R2P National Focal Point and to join the growing Global Network of R2P
Focal Points. We support a voluntary restraint of the veto in the Security Council in
situations of atrocity crimes. We will be present in the High Level Ministerial Meeting
place next 25 September organized by France and Mexico. We hope that this meeting
will allow a substantive and constructive debate

====================

16. Spain will continue to actively participate in international efforts aimed at encouraging
and assisting States to effectively protect their populations from atrocity crimes
