Australia’s Statement at the 2016 UN General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion,
From Commitment to Implementation: Ten Years of Responsibility to Protect
[Transcribed]
26 February 2016
Thank you very much, Mr. Moderator, and let me begin by also thanking the PGA for organizing
this very valuable and very lively debate. Can I especially thank all of our panelists for their very
thoughtful and forward­looking deventions

====================

You only need to take a very quick look at events around the globe to realize that RtoP is
needed more than ever. I think that fundamental point is well accepted. And as the panelists
have done, we see this 10th anniversary as an opportunity not just to take stock on where we’ve
gone on RtoP, but very importantly to look forward on how we can further the implementation of
RtoP in light of the experience to date

====================

One initiative, and it’s been pleasing to see that it has been mentioned by a number of panelists
but also a number of the speakers here today, is the initiative for a General Assembly
resolution. This would be the first substantive resolution of the GA in the 10 years of RtoP’s
existence and importantly also put RtoP firmly on the General Assembly’s agenda going
forward. Others have mentioned how important this GA role is in the foundational document that
all of our heads of states and government adopted. It envisioned a leading role for the General
Assembly in the UN on RtoP

====================

The Slovenian permanent representative mentioned that a zero draft has been put together by a
very broad, cross­regional group and presented to the membership just yesterday. We fully
recognize that there are different perspectives on RtoP and that’s been evident in this room
today. One of the rationales for the resolution that we’ve put forward is precisely so those views
can be shared and common ground identified. We therefore look forward to constructive
engagement in the coming weeks in the negotiations process. We are committed, like my
Ghanan colleague just mentioned, to an open, transparent, inclusive process and to consensus
adoption of this resolution. If I could finally just reiterate Australia’s support for the
French­Mexican initiatives on restraint on the use of the veto, also to the important global
network of RtoP focal points, all important initiatives, and we encourage support for them. Thank
you

====================
