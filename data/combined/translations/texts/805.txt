Papua New Guinea
joins previous speakers in complimenting the SecretaryGeneral, His Excellency Mr. António Guterres, on his
important and timely report (A/72/884) on implementing
the responsibility to protect and on accountability and
prevention. I also want to thank Ambassadors Bird of
Australia and Pobee of Ghana for their leadership on
this important issue

====================

Given the great wars and consequential atrocities
of the twentieth century, their unabated continuation
this century is in itself a wake-up call to our common
humanity and all Governments to be on the alert to
take immediate remedial action where situations of
atrocity crimes arise. It was in that context that world
leaders, in 2005, adopted the World Summit Outcome
document, on the responsibility to protect citizens from
mass atrocity crimes such as genocide, ethnic cleansing,
war crimes and crimes against humanity

====================

The Secretary-General’s report’s key messages
are crystal-clear and put all Member States on notice,
as primary-responsibility custodians, to do more
to protect innocent people from atrocity crimes,
especially women and children, who have often been
used as human shields and suffered sexual violence,
among other crimes. All nation States must work both
individually and collectively to prevent devastating
atrocity crimes, in defence of our common humanity

====================

Civil-society groups and faith-based religious groups

should also support all national and international
efforts in that regard

====================

As the Secretary-General has pointed out, the
responsibility to protect is enshrined in international
human rights and humanitarian law, as well as the
constitutions and legal jurisprudence of all States

====================

It is a tragic fact that atrocity crimes continue to be
perpetrated, violating human rights under both national
and international humanitarian law. Nation States often
find themselves helpless to contain such crimes, all too
often owing to a lack of capacity to prevent insurgency
within national borders. When this is the case, nation
States, within any given regional grouping, should
collaborate and deploy combined regional resources,
including security forces, to address such situations
with a swift humanitarian response

====================

Papua New Guinea, a country still recovering from
conflict, is fully aware of the serious negative impact
that atrocity crimes have on those directly affected. It
takes generations to fully recover from them. In this
regard, the United Nations continues to play a pivotal
role in all post-conflict peacebuilding and rehabilitation
situations, in Papua New Guinea and elsewhere. But it
should not be seen or taken for granted as the sole player
in this respect. Those who commit atrocity crimes must
also be brought to justice. The Organization is only as
good as its Members want it to be, and that means it
must be provided with the appropriate resources for
undertaking the task of sustaining peace

====================

My delegation aligns itself with the statement
delivered by Ambassador Tito, the representative of
Kiribati, on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum (see
A/72/PV.99). Ambassador Tito, a former President of
Kiribati, presided over the Pacific Islands Forum that
adopted the Biketawa Declaration in 2000. Pacific
Island Forum leaders wanted to give priority to the
early-warning and early-action approach collectively
in order to deal with possible atrocity crimes in the
region. That is the Pacific way, our response to the
second pillar of the responsibility to protect, translated
into action.
