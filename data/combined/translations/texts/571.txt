Interactive Debate of the General Assembly
Early Warning and Assessment and the Responsibility to Protect

August 9, 2010

 

Sri President,

pe
eral

 

Let me say hello and thank you for the opportunity to discuss the report of the Secret River Gen

on "Early Warning and Assessment and the responsibility to protect"; tas lo-Éon locumento

A / 64/864, -sebre-alssual my delegation be permitted to state the following:

1. First you need to have in mind that the parameters of responsibility
to protect as it is presented conceptually not yet been defined
intergovernmentally within the UN General Assembly. irrefutable proof
it is resolution A / Res / 63/308, which es'de procedural nature. In this regard,
report of the Secretary-General to the same as above, not only does not reflect this reality, but -
even dangerously otherwise he stated, indicating that there is an agreement of states
members with regard to the responsibility to protect and to its implementation. Inclusive,
aims to simplify the debate to a simple procedural question about how to implement
the concept allegedly already agreed

====================

2. Secondly, we endorse the ideas contained in document A / 63/958, which was
circulated as a concept note by the President of the 63rd General Assembly, His Excellency
Father Miguel d'Escoto, as to the legal monstrosity representing merely suggest
that resolutions of the Security Council are a source of law, and in this case the
international right

====================

3. Entercer place we consider essential to note that because of that there is no
agreed concept of the responsibility to protect, this is a false debate
possible implementation, particularly when we are talking about creating an alert
Early and evaluation regarding the responsibility to protect. This requires us to insist
that the conclusion of the exchange clearer sustained during last interactive discussion
It is that there are the necessary conditions for fair and equal application
conditions of a concept like responsibility to protect, particularly when
It is considering the application of military force by the Security Council, whose reform,
still under discussion, is reason for being antidemocratic nature and therefore ineffective
of this body. Therefore, we reject the claim that is made in this report
(4/64/864) regarding the alleged recognition by this honorable General Assembly
the "function to remain seized of the development and operationalization of responsibility
to protect"; 4. Fourth, from and my delegation, without prejudice to spread in the future more
detail is puzzled at the lack of clarity in paragraph 18 of the report
I quote about the "new internal procedures to speed up and regulate the process
by which the United Nations consider their response "to situations that may
lead to acts of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against
humanity. Such procedures must be analyzed and defined exclusively by the
General Assembly, as hardly recall that the Secretary General has no prerogatives
legislative. This also applies to the idea of ​​creating a joint office with the
objective course of institutionalizing collaboration between the Special Adviser on the
Prevention of Genocide and the Special Adviser, who is responsible for concept development,
political and institutional responsibility to protect

====================

5. In the same vein, we conclude by expressing our concern at the presentation

reports on such sensitive issues when they have not been requested by States
Members by the usual means, ie through a resolution

====================

Thank you Mr. President.
