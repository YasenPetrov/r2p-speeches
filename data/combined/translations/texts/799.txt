At the outset, I would
like to thank the President of the General Assembly
for convening this meeting today and for her
introductory remarks

====================

Slovakia fully aligns itself with the statements
delivered earlier by the observer of the European Union
and by the representative of Denmark on behalf of
the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect

====================

My statement will therefore be very brief. I will focus

on three main points that we would like to add to
todayâ€™s debate

====================

First, Slovakia welcomes the eleventh report of the
Secretary-General (A/73/898), which comes at a time
when the actions of the international community and
Member States fall short of fully deterring atrocity
crimes. There is a much-needed shift from reactive
to preventive actions. Slovakia fully supports the
views and recommendations of the Secretary-General
aimed at strengthening preventive efforts. After all,
prevention is inherently incorporated within the pillars
of the responsibility to protect (R2P). R2P should be
perceived as an opportunity to anticipate atrocity
crimes and to act early to prevent them. Addressing
the root causes of such crimes needs to be a priority
because the best way to protect is to prevent

====================

In 2005, all Member States made a strong
commitment to the responsibility to protect. That
commitment binds Member States to act as primary
protectors of their own populations and to shield them
from potential mass atrocities. In that pursuit, with
the consent of the host State, and preferably at its
own request, the international community can, and
should, extend a helping hand to assist the efforts of
individual States

====================

Secondly, anchoring the protection of individuals
and groups against discrimination and exclusion is as an
essential step, which must be accompanied by universal
access to justice and non-selective accountability. In
that context, we believe that it is vital to reiterate the role
of the International Criminal Court as an independent
and impartial judicial body that steps in where national
jurisdictions are unable or unwilling to address the
issue of accountability. In that capacity, it serves as a
deterrent and a guarantor of the non-recurrence of mass
atrocities. Therefore, we call on all States Members of
the United Nations that have not yet done so to ratify the
Rome Statute and its amendments and thereby help to
achieve its universality and bolster preventive efforts

====================

Thirdly and lastly, as co-Chair of the Group of
Friends of Security Sector Reform, Slovakia believes that
fostering that agenda can contribute to a secure and just
environment and provide guarantees of non-recurrence

====================

Effective security institutions, together with a system
based on the rule of law, can ensure that the rights of
individuals are respected and perpetrators are brought
to justice. The enhancement of national capacities and
the building of strong institutions are key to the pursuit

of resilient systems and, by extension, early action
to prevent atrocities. Strengthening security sector
reform efforts in the aftermath of violence can act as a
catalyst for change towards the overall stabilization and
reconstruction of societies in transition in particular

====================

In conclusion, Slovakia is firmly committed to
the implementation of all pillars of the responsibility
to protect. Only united action can effectively prevent
atrocities and protect the innocent.
