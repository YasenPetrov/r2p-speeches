For Germany, the
responsibility to protect is of special importance. It is
a priority for us and I am therefore very pleased that
we have the opportunity to speak first this afternoon

====================

I would like to thank the President of the General
Assembly for convening today’s debate, and to pay
tribute to Australia and Ghana, which have been the
driving force behind this topic and putting it on our
agenda. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General
for his report (A/72/884) and for his inspiring speech
this morning (see A/72/PV.99). Much has been said
about the responsibility to protect, and I will therefore
be brief and make just six short points

====================

I would first like to align myself with the statements
made this morning by the observer of the European
Union and by the representative of Qatar (see A/72/
PV.99), who spoke on behalf of the Group of Friends of
the Responsibility to Protect, of which we are a member

====================

Secondly, many of this morning’s speakers
discussed conflict prevention, and I listened very
carefully, for instance, to the former President of
Kiribati, who highlighted the issue (see A/72/PV.99). I
think that it is key to the debate on the responsibility to
protect. In other words, we must ensure that we go from
early warning to early action. For Germany that is a
key aspect of the responsibility to protect, and we have
therefore been prioritizing it at the United Nations. We
also believe that the Security Council should feature
conflict prevention on its agenda far more often than
it does, and when Germany assumes its seat on the
Council, starting on 1 January 2019, we will have
conflict prevention on our agenda too

====================

Thirdly, within the family of the United Nations,
the offices that deal with conflict prevention must
assume a more important role, and we have to pay more
attention to this. For us, the United Nations Office on
Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect
is key in that regard, but in the broader sense of conflict
prevention so are the Peacebuilding Commission, the
Peacebuilding Support Office and the Peacebuilding
Fund. All these institutions are crucial to promoting
conflict prevention and deserve our support. In that
context, I would also like to highlight and once again
commend the President of the Assembly, who has
put conflict prevention and, in particular, sustaining
peace — where conflict prevention plays a very
important role — on the agenda during this session

====================

That has been one of the most important efforts of
his presidency

====================

This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches
delivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only

====================

They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member
of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506
(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official
Document System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org)

====================

Many speakers have emphasized my fourth
point, which is that the primary responsibility for the
responsibility to protect lies with Member States. In
his statement this morning, the Secretary-General said
that the principle’s first pillar refers to the primary
responsibility of States to protect all populations
within their territory from atrocity crimes. If a
country is to assume that responsibility, it must build
resilience — resilience against violations of human
rights and against mass atrocities and ethnic cleansing

====================

In that regard, I would like to cite my colleague from
Ghana, one of the founding members of the Group of
Friends of the Responsibility to Protect, who insisted
that in order to build resilience we need functional
institutions of good governance at all levels (see A/72/
PV.99). That includes a robust human rights regime,
inclusiveness and respect for diversity and the rule of
law, with a strong judiciary

====================

Fifthly, to return to inclusiveness, for that, civil
society must play a strong role. It has the closest links
to the people. The members of civil society know what
is happening in their country and they may also be in a
position to give the earliest indications when something
is going wrong. To refer once again to my colleague
from Ghana, she said that collaboration with civil
society as a strategic partner in the implementation
of the responsibility to protect is very important to
her country. I therefore think that the debates that we
are having on the responsibility to protect here at the
United Nations would also benefit from the inclusion
of representatives of civil society, if possible, and I
would like to make a general appeal to that effect to
the Secretary-General, as well as to all the various
agencies and offices. This week we are holding a highlevel conference of heads of counter-terrorism agencies
on 28 June, but unfortunately here at the United
Nations civil-society organizations were excluded from
that discussion

====================

With regard to my last point, which is about
accountability, if we are to prevent mass atrocities,
mechanisms for accountability must be in place. We
have to ensure that we establish an environment in
which no one who commits a crime against humanity
or mass atrocities can even think about going free. Such
people must feel that they will have to constantly be
looking over their shoulders for the rest of their lives,
and they must fear being caught. I would therefore
like to take this opportunity to plead for support and
cooperation with the International, Impartial and

Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation
and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most
Serious Crimes under International Law Committed
in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011. If
prevention fails in Syria or Myanmar, as we have seen,
we need accountability

====================

I thank the President of the General Assembly once
again for putting this item on the agenda.
