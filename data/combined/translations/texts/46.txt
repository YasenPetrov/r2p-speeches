Statement of H.E. Mr. Marc Pecsteen de Buytswerve,
Ambassador, Permanent Representative
General Assembly of the United Nations
Informal interactive dialogue of the General Assembly on
the report of the Secretary-General
on the Responsibility to Protect
« The responsibility to protect
and accountability for prevention »
New York, September 6, 2017

Mr. President,
Mr. Secretary-General,
Mr. Under-Secretary-General,
Mr. Special Advisers,
First, I would like to thank the President of the General Assembly for organizing this debate. Let me also
express my deep appreciation to the Secretary-General for his excellent first report on the Responsibility
to Protect, which reminds all of us about the urgency to act together and to implement R2P at national
level

====================

Belgium aligns itself with the statement of the European Union and the statement delivered on behalf of
the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect. I would also like to take this opportunity to share
with you some views in my national capacity

====================

1. The legal, moral and political dimensions of the Responsibility to Protect
As the Secretary-General rightly pointed out in his report, the principle of the Responsibility to Protect
encompasses legal, moral and political responsibilities. We all subscribed to paragraphs 138 and 139 of
the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document. The proper implementation of these paragraphs and the
operationalization of the three mutually supporting and non-sequential R2P pillars, however, remains a
continuous challenge

====================

Atrocity crime prevention can only be effective if we have appropriate structures in place and all the
diplomatic, civilian and, as a last resort, military capabilities available to foster resilience, and ensure
effective early warning and timely action. Therefore, it is absolutely crucial to continuously develop our
institutional preparedness at national, regional and global level, particularly at the crucial stages of early
prevention, and early reaction to warning signs. I’m convinced that by increasing Member States’
accountability for institutionalizing R2P at each level, we can close the gap between principle and
practice

====================

The recommendations put forward in the Secretary General’s report are particularly helpful in this
respect. We wholeheartedly support the Secretary General’s call to further develop the link between
R2P and human rights. As outlined in the Secretary General’s report, the UN Human Rights Council, with
its Special Procedures and the Universal Periodic Review process, can help us gauge how States are
strengthening human rights domestically, and what this means in terms of their institutional resilience
to the threat of mass atrocities. Appointing a national focal point can also be particularly relevant in this
regard

====================

Belgium would also like to command the Secretary-General for his recommendation to put a specific
item on atrocity crimes prevention and the implementation of the Responsibility to Protect on the
agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. This has been a longstanding request of Belgium and
many other States from different regional groups. Belgium is well aware that there are the different
views with regard to the scope and limits of R2P. However, it is crucial for the health of the international
order that the existing differences in interpretation be reduced and dealt with cooperatively. Flexibility
from all sides is key. We strongly believe that an open dialogue among UN Member States can only
benefit the further development of the principle, we all agreed to 12 years ago

====================

2. The fight against impunity
Strengthening national capacities to fight impunity and creating a culture of effective accountability for
atrocity crimes has an important deterrent effect and is therefore a crucial R2P tool. It is also worth
pointing out that every State has an international obligation to investigate and prosecute those
responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. That means that every state has to
make sure that these most serious international crimes are part of the national legal order

====================

While the cross-border elements of these crimes make their prosecution more difficult, they are of
concern to the entire international community and cannot remain unpunished. As a practical tool to
enable States to both comply with their international obligations and empower their national judiciaries,
Argentina, Belgium, the Netherlands, Senegal and Slovenia propose to open negotiations for a
multilateral treaty on mutual legal assistance and extradition which would facilitate better practical
cooperation between States investigating and prosecuting atrocity crimes

====================

Lastly, I want to underline the importance of current efforts pursued in the Security Council to support
Iraq in fighting impunity for the atrocities committed on its territory, as specific pillar two initiative

====================

Belgium is ready to share its expertise in this regard and to assist the Iraqi Government in its efforts to
deliver justice to the victims of the atrocities. Belgium is proud to also have been involved in the
establishment of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism on international crimes
committed in Syria, i.a. by providing financial support, and looks forward to the full operationalization of
the Mechanism

====================

Mr. President, I thank you for your attention

====================
