General Assembly informal interactive dialogue
on the Report of the Secretary-General on the
Responsibility to Protect
Statement by Brian Flynn
Deputy Permanent Representative of Ireland to
the United Nations
6 September 2017—New York
Mr. President,
Thank you for organizing today’s debate, which offers an opportunity to reaffirm our strong
support for the Responsibility to Protect and recall the spirit of common endeavor that
underpinned its adoption by consensus in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document

====================

My delegation, which aligns itself with the statement delivered on behalf of the European Union,
also thanks the Secretary-General for his address this morning and for his substantive report,
which explores the legal, political and moral accountability inherent in the three pillars of the
Responsibility to Protect

====================

Responsibility can be defined as being accountable for commitments made. Regretfully, in the
twelve years which have passed since the 2005 World Summit, we have regularly been
confronted by obstacles to preventing or responding effectively as an international community to
the commission of mass atrocities and in upholding international humanitarian law. As the
Secretary General’s report makes clear, too often our actions do not live up to our words

====================

Ireland strongly supports the Secretary-General’s placing of conflict prevention at the core of his
mandate. This means exploring all aspects of prevention across the work of the UN. His report
before us today addresses an important element of conflict prevention – accountability and the
need to move towards tangible implementation of the Responsibility to Protect

====================

We therefore welcome his recommendations on how the UN can improve its work by enhancing
coordination across the system and ensuring the Responsibility to Protect is fully included in the
integrated prevention platform. We support the call for a specific item on atrocity crimes
prevention and the implementation of the Responsibility to Protect to be placed on the agenda of
the UN General Assembly

====================

We also welcome the Secretary General’s call for the Security Council to make better use of
available tools and to be ready to act more effectively on atrocity prevention. In this regard we
reaffirm our strong commitment to the ACT code of conduct on mass atrocity crime

====================

The shift towards implementation and accountability means engagement not just with this
Assembly or the Security Council however. The Secretary General’s report rightly identifies the
Human Rights Council, the UPR and the entities and agencies of the UN as having an important
role to play. Coherence and clarity of approach can lead to transparency. Engagement across the

UN can also build capacity and understanding across member states, thus bolstering our
collective efforts and commitments under Pillar 2

====================

Mr. President,
Ireland is grateful for the opportunity today to reaffirm its strong support for the principles which
underpin the Responsibility to Protect; principles which are at the core of what the UN stands
for

====================

As a longstanding contributor to UN peacekeeping missions Irelands was happy to endorse the
Kigali Principles on the Protection of Civilians last year. In addition, in furtherance of our
commitment to international criminal justice, earlier this year Ireland supported the
establishment of the international Impartial and Independent Mechanism for Syria

====================

Mr. President,
The Secretary-General has set out clearly the tasks ahead of all of us if we are to close the gap
between actions and words. Responsibility and accountability are essential tools in developing a
coherent approach to prevention. As the Secretary General said here this morning, we have to do
more and better

====================

It is the responsibility of each of us to ensure that all avenues to sustaining peace are fully
explored
