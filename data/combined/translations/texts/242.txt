General Assembly
Responsibility to Protect - Convened by the Thematic Event
President of the General Assembly "From Commitment to
Implementation: Ten Years of the Responsibility to Protect New
York, February 26, 2016

Mister President,
Switzerland joins the discourse of the group of friends of the responsibility to protect and wishes
add a few words in his national capacity

====================

First, my delegation welcomes the work of the Office of the Special Advisor to the
Prevention of Genocide and the Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect

====================

We hope that this office can leverage the efforts made by the wider
United Nations in early warning, particularly to avoid violence in
electoral contexts

We also welcome the creation of a group of friends of the responsibility to protect
Geneva and believe that this will strengthen the synergies between New York and Geneva

====================

During the ten years since the Millennium Summit, the international community
recognized the critical importance of protection; However, the persistence of atrocities
shows that there are still major challenges. Too often it is the impunity
encouraging the commission of future violations. It should be recalled that when the
States do not have the will or the ability to prosecute perpetrators of international crimes,
the International Criminal Court can play a key role

We therefore can not but endorse the statements of the Secretary-General who, in his
latest report says that the concept of responsibility to protect is in reality
a pivotal stage in its evolution

====================

We support the various efforts, including the initiative of Australia, Botswana,
Brazil, Denmark, Ghana, Guatemala, South Korea and Slovenia of
present a draft resolution on the responsibility to protect. Institutionalizing
dialogue in the area of ​​the responsibility to protect in the General Assembly
will lead a beneficial discussion to this theme. As States
members, it is time we put more emphasis on the implementation and
we all continue our efforts to the concept of

"Sovereignty as

responsibility "is translated into acts that may have an impact on the ground

====================

Mister President,
In this context where the news might make us doubt on the commitment of States to
prevent the atrocities, the success of the recent meeting of the Global Action Against Mass Atrocity
Crimes (GAAMAC) in Manila, gives us hope:
This second international event, supported by Switzerland, and attended by 52 countries to
reflect and generate concrete initiatives for building architectures
National prevention of atrocities, we reinforced the idea that a community
State associated with the civil society, actively mobilized to provide answers
innovative while respecting sovereignty. We invite all Member States it
associate

====================

In conclusion, we wish to recall the existence of the code of conduct on the use of law
veto in cases of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity developed by
ACT group (Accountability, Coherence, Transparency) which requires that members of the
Security Council, present or future abstain from voting against a resolution to
prevent or stop crimes of genocide, war crimes or crimes against
humanity. The Code is currently supported by 110 Member States and invite them
all states to subscribe

====================

Thank you
