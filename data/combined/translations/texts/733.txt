Ambassador, Permanent Representative
at

General Assembly

 

Debate on the Responsibility to Protect

New York, 09.11.2013

 

Belgium fully supports the statement has | EU

====================

We have read with great interest the report of the Secretary-General

====================

The identification of factors implementation has lead to mass atrocities and
concrete solutions to mitigate the risk of their commission offer each-state
Member many tools for identifying and ensuring that the obligations it
incumbent on behalf of the responsibility to protect

====================

Let me recall that Belgium attaches priority to special
support the concept of responsibility to protect and the prevention of atrocities
mass. We thank the Secretary General and the President of the General Assembly
holding this informal discussion of obligations under the first pillar of the
responsibility to protect, namely the first and permanent responsibility | State
to protect its populations from genocide, crimes against I'humanité, crimes
war and ethnic cleansing

====================

During the past year we have di see that same concept and implementation
ceuvre of our solemn commitment to the responsibility to protect encounter
substantial challenges. Belgium therefore wishes to reiterate that this international standard,
same if it is fragile, is alive. It is our duty to develop - with
ATTENTION TO prevention aspect - and strengthen

====================

1. In a first point, I would like to share briefly some lessons
learned for Implementation in Belgium of mechanisms to strengthen this
primary responsibility of the state. They meet the needs of a multicultural state, with
the plurality of opinions, societal visions, manner of expression and appeal
the tensions that can arise. For example, I would mention only: - The constitutional protection of minorities, which ensures the serenity of the debate,
each social group knowing that their rights will not be harmed

====================

- Uétablissement Center for I'égalité opportunities and the fight against racism,
whose mission is promoting I'égalité and the fight against discrimination

====================

- introduction of legislation criminalizing hate speech and the
a speech inciting discrimination

====================

- The transcription into national law of international obligations to prosecute
the perpetrators of genocide, war crimes and crimes against
Humanity, or those who incite to commit such crimes. And, more than
the existence of these laws is their implementation concrete matters

====================

Entrusting | implementation of these laws has police and magistrates
specialist, who will make a priority of their policy of prosecution,
is a success guarantee. Civil society can and must also play a crucial Rele of
surveillance and tracking in the courts of such acts, has own ignite
relations between various social groups

====================

- Belgium has recently appointed a focal point that R2P will examine how
we can improve our efforts to prevent heinous crimes. She is
ready to share its experience with Member States which consider the
appointment of a focal point

====================

A cété the development of national preventive mechanisms, it is also
essential to continue to support the development and mechanisms I'expansion
international and regional prevention. In this regard, I would stress
"Importance of good cooperation with the Special Procedures assumed by the
Human Rights Council, which have an important Rele as a warning mechanism
Early and prevention. In this regard, issue standing invitations to
mandate holders of special procedures may be cited as another
measure to address the risk of atrocious crimes.

====================

Belgium is also active in the framework of the Peacebuilding Commission of the
peace and believes that it can also play a preventive Rele as system
early warning. By working closely with local partners,
specific configurations of the Peacebuilding Commission may peace
a unique perspective on the situation and can special time
useful mobilize, inform and advise the national players and the community
International appropriate manner. In this regard, I wish I solicit the views of
Panelists on such preventive Rele of the Peacebuilding Commission

====================

2. In a second point I must mention international news, and more
particuligrement, the conflict in Syria. The first pillar of the responsibility to protect,
concept endorsed by the World Summit in 2005 and has repeated many times then ,,
is based on the state's first and ongoing responsibility to protect its
population. In Syria, this responsibility therefore rests first and foremost | Syrian state, which
he returns in particular to apply, as any party to an armed conflict, all
standards of international humanitarian law clearly violated

====================

Another aspect arising from this first pillar is the fight against | impunity and, in the
Syrian cases, particularly impunity with regard to crimes committed during the conflict
devastated the country for more than two years. Today, the International Criminal Court
best placed to carry out this mission. Belgium would, again, at this
informal discussion, repeat | 'appeal to the Security Council in January this year,
in a letter co-signed with cdtés fifty-seven Member States, of
to the International Criminal Court on the situation in Syria

====================

3. Finally, I would like to thank the four Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, M

====================

Dieng for the preparation of this report. On behalf of my country I would also
take this opportunity to welcome the new Special Adviser
for the responsibility to protect, Jennifer Welsh. We are preparing the
greatest interest has a good cooperation
