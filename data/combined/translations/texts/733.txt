KINGDOM OF BELGIUM

Statement by HE Ms. Bénédicte Frankinet,
Ambassador, Permanent Representative
at

the general Assembly

 

Debate on the Responsibility to Protect

New York, 09.11.2013

 

Belgium fully supports the EU statement

====================

We have read with great interest the report of the Secretary-General

====================

The identification of specific factors lead to mass atrocities and
concrete solutions to mitigate the risk of their commission gives each-state
Member many tools for identifying and ensuring that the obligations it
incumbent on behalf of the responsibility to protect

====================

Let me recall that Belgium attaches special priority to any
support the concept of responsibility to protect and the prevention of atrocities
mass. We thank the Secretary General and the President of the General Assembly
holding this informal discussion of obligations under the first pillar of the
responsibility to protect, namely the first and permanent responsibility of the State
to protect its populations from genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes
war and ethnic cleansing

====================

During the past year we have had to find that the same concept and implementation
work of our solemn commitment to the responsibility to protect encounter
substantial challenges. Belgium therefore wishes to reiterate that this international standard,
albeit fragile, is alive. It is our duty to develop - with
special attention to the prevention aspect - and strengthen

====================

1. In a first point, I want to briefly share some lessons
learned from the implementation in Belgium of mechanisms to strengthen this
primary responsibility of the State. They meet the needs of a multicultural state, with
the plurality of opinions, societal visions, so to speak and cater
the tensions that can arise. For example, I would mention only: - The constitutional protection of minorities, which ensures the serenity of the debate,
each social group knowing that their rights will not be harmed

====================

- The establishment of the Center for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism,
whose mission is the promotion of equality and the fight against discrimination

====================

- The introduction of legislation criminalizing hate speech and the
speech inciting discrimination

====================

- The transcription into national law of international obligations to prosecute
the perpetrators of genocide, war crimes and crimes against
humanity, or those who incite to commit such crimes. And, more than
the existence of such legislation, it is implementation specific matters

====================

Entrusting the application of these laws to police and magistrates
specialist, who will make a priority of their policy of prosecution,
is a guarantee of success. Civil society also can and should play a crucial role
surveillance and tracking in the courts of such acts, specific to ignite
relations between various social groups

====================

- Belgium has recently appointed a focal point that R2P will examine how
we can improve our efforts to prevent heinous crimes. She is
ready to share its experience with Member States planning to
appointment of a focal point

====================

Alongside the development of national preventive mechanisms, it is also
essential to continue to support the development and expansion of mechanisms
international and regional prevention. In this regard, I would stress
the importance of good cooperation with the Special Procedures assumed by the
Human Rights Council, which have an important role as an alert mechanism
Early and prevention. In this regard, issue standing invitations to
mandate holders of special procedures can be cited as another
able to face the risk of atrocious crimes.

====================

Belgium is also active in the framework of the Peacebuilding Commission of the
peace and believes that it can also play a preventive role as system
early warning. By working closely with local partners,
specific configurations of the Peacebuilding Commission may peace
a unique perspective on the particular situation and may well in time
useful mobilize, inform and advise the national players and the community
International appropriately. In this regard, I would seek | reviews
Panelists on such preventive role of the Peacebuilding Commission

====================

2. In a second point, I have to mention international news, and more
Specifically, the conflict in Syria. The first pillar of the responsibility to protect,
concept endorsed by the 2005 World Summit and repeatedly thereafter,
is based on the state's first and ongoing responsibility to protect its
population. In Syria, this responsibility therefore rests first and foremost on the Syrian state, which
he returns in particular to apply, as a party to an armed conflict, all
standards of international humanitarian law clearly violated

====================

Another aspect arising from this first pillar is the fight against impunity and, in the
Syrian cases, particularly impunity with regard to crimes committed during the conflict
devastated the country for more than two years. Today, the International Criminal Court
best placed to carry out this mission. Belgium would, again, at this
informal discussion, repeat the call for the Security Council in January this year,
in a letter co-signed along with fifty-seven other Member States, of
to the International Criminal Court on the situation in Syria

====================

3. Finally, I wish to thank the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, M

====================

Dieng for the preparation of this report. On behalf of my country I would also
take this opportunity to welcome the new Special Adviser
for the responsibility to protect, Jennifer Welsh. We are preparing the
greater interest in good cooperation
