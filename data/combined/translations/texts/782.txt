Let me begin by thanking
the President for convening this important meeting on
the responsibility to protect (R2P)

====================

My delegation aligns itself with the statement
delivered by the representative of Denmark on behalf

of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect
(see A/73/PV.93)

====================

We welcome the Secretary-General’s report
(A/73/898) and its emphasis on early warning and
early action

====================

Allow me to use this opportunity to acknowledge
the tireless efforts of Ms. Karen Smith, Special Adviser
to the Secretary-General on the Responsibility to
Protect, and Mr. Adama Dieng, Under-SecretaryGeneral and Special Adviser to the Secretary-General
on the Prevention of Genocide, to mainstream R2P
within the United Nations system, including through
the Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes

====================

Nigeria welcomes the inclusion of the responsibility
to protect and the prevention of genocide, war crimes,
ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity on the
formal agenda of the General Assembly at its seventythird session

====================

My delegation agrees with the Secretary General’s
report in that concerted action makes a difference. We
support the role of regional and subregional organizations
in advancing the concept of the responsibility to protect

====================

As appropriately reflected in the Secretary-General’s
report, there are several instances where the African
Union, the Economic Community of West African States
and the United Nations have worked in unison to avert
the escalation of tensions, including those spelled out in
the responsibility to protect. We urge the international
community to continue to support such regional and
subregional endeavours so as to enable them to play
a more effective role in protecting populations and
providing early warning and early action to prevent the
commission of atrocious crimes. Nigeria supports the
efforts of the Secretary-General to maintain this issue
on the agenda of the General Assembly

====================

The international community is aware of the Boko
Haram terrorist organization’s mindless destruction and
mass atrocities in Nigeria and the Lake Chad and Sahel
regions, which have resulted in the forced displacement
of people in the affected areas over the years. Already,
substantive progress is being made through the
renewed cooperation and strategic combined counterterrorism operations of Nigeria and its immediate
neighbours under the auspices of the Lake Chad
Basin Multinational Joint Task Force against Boko
Haram. To address the negative impacts of terrorist
acts, Nigeria has adopted an integrated and holistic
approach to both forced displacement and conflict-

affected populations, anchored on four pillars: the safe,
dignified and voluntary return and resettlement of the
displaced population; reconciliation, peacebuilding
and community cohesion; local governance and citizen
engagement; and community, security, justice, human
rights and small arms control

====================

Nigeria believes that national Governments and
the international community must do more to curb
hate speech, especially in the media, as it can lead
to the violation of human rights and mass atrocity
crimes, as witnessed in Rwanda against the Tutsis
and in Myanmar against the Rohingya. Nigeria will
continue to join like-minded countries in emphasizing
the need to prevent atrocity crimes within the broader
context of human rights protection, particularly at the
Human Rights Council. Nigeria reiterates the need for
all Member States to uphold their obligations under
international human rights law, humanitarian law and
refugee law, which underpins the commitment to the
responsibility to protect. Nigeria is committed to the
human rights instruments and supports all strategies
at the regional and international levels to promote and
protect human rights

====================

Nigeria subjected itself for review for the
third time, through the Universal Periodic Review
process. Since the previous review, civil-military
cooperation in the fight against terrorism, insurgency
and other internal security operations has been
strengthened through several measures, including

the incorporation of modules on international human
rights and international human rights law in the
training curriculum for the military. Let me avail
myself of this opportunity to reiterate our commitment
to implementing the recommendations we adopted
during the latest Universal Periodic Review process
and state that Nigeria will continue to cooperate with
human rights treaty bodies to address risk factors more
systematically, as well as strengthen national efforts

====================

We are committed to the implementation of our legal
and institutional frameworks to alleviate the suffering
of the most vulnerable people in our society, especially
women, girls and children, from the impact of terrorist
attacks. Policy interventions targeted at improving the
social status of women, improving women’s economic
base, ensuring girl-child education and consolidating
their political rights are already in place

====================

In conclusion, let me reaffirm Nigeria’s
commitment to the responsibility to protect initiative
and provide assurance of Nigeria’s readiness to deepen
cooperation and dialogue with a view to protecting
lives and properties within its territory.
