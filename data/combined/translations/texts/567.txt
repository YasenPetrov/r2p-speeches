EARLY WARNING, EVALUATION AND RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT
9 August 2010

Mr. Chairman and Messrs. Delegates,

On the occasion of this important dialogue, Costa Rica would like to reiterate, once again, its
commitment to the responsibility to protect concept under construction, which was
captured, thanks to the overwhelming support of member countries of the UN, in Document
End of the World Summit 2005 and we hope it will be transformed into a true
legal concept sooner rather than later

====================

We thank the panelists presentations

====================

The Holocaust during World War 2 *, in which millions of people were massacred
by the machinery of Nazi terror and murder, it was the one that gave rise to the legal concepts of
GENOCIDE AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. The promise then,
NEVER AGAIN, but it has gained strength and contains a goal shared by all
people of good faith and states that care about human rights and the welfare of their
citizens and humanity in general has not been sufficient to prevent new crimes
ETHNIC CLEANSING like. Remember what happened Srebrenica, Rwanda or Kosovo, or
atrocities of Kampuchea regime against its own citizens. But the will of the
international community has been strengthened, to definitively eradicate these crimes
horrendous

====================

CR, state sovereignty is not a sufficient condition to guarantee human rights to
people who are the true possessors of this sovereignty. We reaffirm our
recognition of the sovereignty of states, but we want to move to this sovereignty
reach fulfillment in the lives of its inhabitants. In this regard, the development of human rights has
been largely a process whereby people are, daily, exercise subjects. Recall that in the Charter of this Organization is the seed of
This concept, light reflected in the phrase "We the peoples of the United Nations"

====================

With the same force we defend this vision entailed the responsibility of
PROTECTING express our conviction that its legitimacy depends on an application
consistent, non-selective and consistent with the principles of international law

====================

Costa Rica wants to remember the commitments of the 2005 World Summit to increase
capacity of the UN on early warning and assessment of potential
CASE commission of these crimes, as well as training to protect the population and
assist before crises erupt. PREVENTION IS THE BEST WAY
TO PROTECT

====================

That's why it is so important that, when states lack sufficient capacity in this
field, it is necessary the action of the international community through prevention,
logistical and technical assistance, through diplomatic means and peaceful humanitarian. But when
these peaceful means prove ineffective and national authorities evidently not
protect their populations, then a more robust intervention is necessary, according to
the regulations of the UN Charter

====================

In this regard, we appreciate and welcome the report of the Secretary-General,
A / 64/864, on the linkages between early warning, Evaluation and Accountability
Protect, supplementing its report last year. Of the report rescued the link
established between the likelihood of more effective to deal with situations under
consideration and adoption of specific and preventive measures at an early stage, so
as evaluating the circumstances of each case to analyze the risk of occurrence

====================

Similarly, the eventual decision to take industrial action must be based on assessments
timely and careful, you always have human beings as the focus of their
concerns

====================

For this, a key player in the field is the Office of the Special Adviser on the
Prevention of Genocide, which should gather relevant information on demonstrations
racism, xenophobia and intolerance that can lead to serious violations and
massive Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law, and at the same time to alert and analyze
make recommendations to the Secretary General and the Security Council, so that they can
act in time. This requires, in turn, coordination and information flow throughout the
System, particularly through the action of the field offices, so standardized and
unified, inform the focal point capable and competent to transmit alerts
Early and recommendations to the officer level decisions and actions

====================

All these capabilities must be built transversally along the System
UN, even in everyday functions, up to the country teams

====================

Special Rapporteurs, Special Envoys, and other mechanisms and responsible personal
well appointed, they should be especially sensitive to these issues and act accordingly,
maintaining presence on the ground. Similarly, coordination and exchange of information
with regional organizations and attention to the proposals of civil society and NGOs, mechanisms must be taken into account for a better understanding of the scope of
a situation on these issues as sensitive and potentially serious

====================

History has taught us hard and miserably, it is not necessary to have a
armed conflict so that these crimes are committed. Therefore, they should get in
up all available tools to detect such risks early,
particularly, the mechanisms mentioned in the report of the SG

====================

However the history of unacceptable failures, both the UN and the community
international on these serious issues, CR believes it is possible to avoid them in the future, and for this, the
binding capacity and coordination achieved between all players in the system, under the
directly responsible leadership and overcoming any hint of complicity in
risks or obvious facts, is a key

====================

Our country believes that all states and governments should commit to making a
open invitation for an assessment of the situation in these areas, starting with the
Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide

====================

We also believe that actions to develop skills in areas such as respect
all and promoting the human rights of minorities, technical assistance for reform
the security and justice sectors to make them more effective and at the same time respectful of
HR can play an important role in preventing these heinous crimes. No
forget that, ultimately, the best protection comes from respect for the rule of law,
democracy and free participation of citizens in decision-making

====================

Another essential link in the chain of protection, is prevent impunity

====================

We support the proposal of the SG to the Assembly next year to continue the discussion
on the Responsibility to Protect, focusing especially on the implementation of the
it contains mechanisms and the role to be played by regional organizations

====================

Costa Rica is convinced that the implement effectively the commitments
in the matter were agreed at the Summit of 2005 and later, the UN will strengthen its
credibility, it is not acceptable to recur tragedies such as these

====================

Finally, arriving at this stage of this process of analysis and collective construction of a
thought so important and essential in the framework of our obligations as an organization,
Costa Rica believes that in situations of massive violation of Human Rights, specifically
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, the question of
international community is not whether to act, but the form and timing for
do what. In this sense, the development already achieved in the construction of Responsibility
Protect offers a range of actions graded for each of the moments of the problem,
which should serve as one of the main guides

====================

Thank you Mr. Chairman and Messrs. Delegates.
