Group of Friends of R2P Geneva
Interactive dialogue on the joint study of the Special Rapporteur on the
promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence and
the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide on
the contribution of transitional justice to the prevention of gross violations and
abuses of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian
law, including genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity, and their recurrence

====================

2 March 2018
Mr. President,
I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Group of Friends of R2P

====================

We thank the Special Rapporteur and the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General for their
substantive joint study

====================

Preventing genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing is the raison
d’être of R2P. The report underlines that violations and abuses of human rights can lead to
atrocities and related crimes. We appreciate the unpacking in the joint study of the objectives
of atrocity prevention and the place of transitional justice processes in this context

====================

We also appreciate the many examples of the usefulness of the Framework of Analysis for
Atrocity Crimes, produced by the Joint Office for Genocide Prevention and the
Responsibility to Protect

====================

Mr. Special Rapporteur, Mr. Special Adviser of the Secretary-General,
You note that expertise on prevention is scattered across various disciplines. You propose a
framework approach in order to strengthen upstream prevention. How should the UN go
about it and what role do you propose for the HRC?
You recommend a joint assessment of the vulnerability of each country to atrocities at the
country level. We acknowledge that this recommendation is sensitive to the fact that each
situation is context-specific. Likewise, you recommend that a comprehensive prevention
framework should be developed. In practice, which entity within the UN system
should have the lead, especially if this recommendation is not universally
accepted by states? Is there merit in assisting States in assessing their
vulnerability to atrocities?
Thank you
