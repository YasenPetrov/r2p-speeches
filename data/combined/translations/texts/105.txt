Statement delivered by Ecuador – Informal Interactive dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2017
[TRANSLATION]
Moderator,
We are holding this interactive dialogue which allows us to clearly express the position of our
country upon such an important issue for the international community. We would we like to
thank the Secretary-General for his report on the Responsibility to Protect. The resolution 6801
of 2001 clearly shows what the Responsibility to Protect is when it is clear that a state cannot or
it enables willing to protect its own population. The international community’s commitment to
adopting collective measures as mentioned in this resolution can only can only happen through
the Security Council in compliance with the United Nations Charter. Any use of force outside this
framework is illegal and illegitimate with no legal value and is an act of aggression against a
sovereign state, whoever may commit it and whatever excuse they might use to justify it. The
state of Ecuador recognizes the Responsibility to Protect population’s intrinsic notion of
sovereignty of states, but it rejects the notion of preventive use of force as part of the concept
of the Responsibility to Protect. We would like to highlight a few substantial elements in this
discussion

====================

First of all, R2P is a concept which is still being analyzed and discussed between the member
states of the organization and is undergoing this process. Only the General Assembly of the
United Nations has the legal capacity and authority to move forward with this definition, in order
to set the conceptual parameters, as well as the institutional and political parameters for it, in
order to make the Responsibility to Protect practicable

====================

Secondly, it is recognized that conflicts worldwide are linked to situations of discrimination,
marginalization, exclusion and illegal occupation of territory. These are conflicts which cannot be
resolved just by using force

====================

Thirdly, for my delegation it is very clear that the Responsibility to Protect applies to crimes under
paragraphs 138 and 139 of the resolution mentioned with regard to war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity. In other words, this is what we are talking about and resolving
conflicts via peaceful means is the only legal and affective way to go in order to avoid such crimes
from being committed, as under the Charter of the United Nations and international law and the
various measures of application. We need to adopt measures in a timely and decisive way and
this can only be done if the member states are fully sure that the Responsibility to Protect will be
used exclusively to prevent crimes as described above and not as a pretext for other interventions
for a political end

====================

Moderator,
Finally, we should like to state the legitimacy of the concept of R2P can only be based upon the
following elements: establishing clearly the motives which can be considered as sufficient to
legitimize international intervention. Also, clearly establish using a case by case analysis the

limitations or restrictions of the possible intervention, with regard to things like a change in
regime or territory. The use of force must be a final resort and used when other peaceful means
of dispute settlements have been exhausted, as under the Security Council. Other measures
following on from resolutions will avoid the use of force so it does not go beyond those limits
fixed on the concept of security

====================

Finally, the United Nations Charter must be followed in the way in which military troops acting
on behalf of the international community can be deployed so that military operations are not
privatized

====================

Thank you very much

====================
