Statement delivered by the Principality of Liechtenstein – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6
September 2017
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM UN WEBCAST]
Thank you very much

====================

Mr. Moderator we thank the Secretary-General for his first report on the Responsibility to Protect
and the focus he has placed on accountability for prevention, which we very much welcome. We
do believe that this links very nice with his overall prevention agenda and also gives an
opportunity to focus in particular on Pillars One and Two of the R2P concept. It is our view that it
would be politically useful to do so, and also to remind ourselves that Pillar Three reflected in the
R2P norm is an option that is to be resorted to once all other option shave been exhausted. It
certainly as has been pointed out in this debate, that the use of force is possible under the R2P
concept with the authorization by the UN Security Council in accordance with the authority it is
given under the Charter of the United Nations

====================

We are very grateful that many states have referenced in this debate the act code of conduct on
mass atrocity crimes, which is currently supported by 113 member states. We do believe that this
is the most meaningful contribution to making the R2P concept operational in practice. It sends a
clear message to the members of the Council, the majority of which have accepted the [ACT] Code
of Conduct to fulfill its role as the guardian for international peace and security and its obligation
to end and prevent mass atrocity crimes

====================

We will continue working with the Secretary-General on best ways to implement the [ACT] Code
of Conduct, and also with the membership to further increase the political support given to the
Code. We will to this end organize a side-event in the framework of the high-level week, to which
everybody is very warmly invited and we hope that more states will take this opportunity to join
the code of conduct

====================

We welcome in particular the willingness of the Secretary-General to put relevant information
before the Security Council in particular and specifically the letter he has just sent with respect to
the situation in Myanmar, which is exactly in line with what the Code of Conduct [signatories are]
foreseeing

====================

In conclusion, we would like to remind our colleagues that protecting populations also means to
holding those who commit atrocity crimes accountable for their actions, primary responsibility of
course in this respect lies with national judiciaries, but we do have as a complementary measure
the International Criminal Court, that can step in when national judiciaries, as they unfortunately
often do, fail to live up to their obligations. We call on everybody to enhance universality of the
Rome Statute, and to also ratify the Kampala amendments on the Crime of Aggression, which
makes the jurisdiction of the Court complete

====================

Finally, the ICC not a panacea and cannot become active in all situations and it’s not only the
Security Council that can become meaningful in this respect, but also the General Assembly, as it
has done in creating the international impartial and independent mechanism for the crimes
committed in Syria, which is a novel and creative way of ensuring that there is no impunity for the
worst crimes under international law. We call on everybody to support the mechanism financially
and politically

====================

Finally, we of course support the inclusion of an agenda item of R2P in agenda the General
Assembly. Thank you
