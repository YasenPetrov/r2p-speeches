(spoke in Spanish):
We would like to thank the President of the General
Assembly for convening this debate, and we also
welcome the recently published report of the SecretaryGeneral (A/73/898) entitled “Responsibility to protect:
lessons learned for prevention”

====================

We associate ourselves with the statement delivered
on behalf of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to
Protect (R2P), of which we are a part (see A/73/PV.93)

====================

I would like to recall that from the outset Chile has
supported the concept of R2P in the terms established
by the Heads of State and Government in paragraphs
138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome
document. In that regard, we reaffirm our commitment
and are gratified by the inclusion of R2P in the formal
agenda of the present session of the General Assembly,
where we support its inclusion as a permanent item

====================

The responsibility to protect is based on three
mutually supporting and fundamental pillars, which
need not be applied in any particular order. In that regard,

we firmly believe that the pillars of the responsibility to
protect are so intertwined that, in practice, they cannot
be applied sequentially. On the contrary, they form part
of an indivisible and non-exclusive whole. We therefore
call for the full and consistent implementation of its
three pillars, which is necessary if we are to prevent the
commission of the greatest evils

====================

The importance of conflict prevention efforts
cannot be overemphasized, as set forth in the first pillar
of the responsibility to protect. The role of women in
prevention is also critical. In the same vein, the joint
and coordinated work of the various institutions and
mechanisms of the Organization, including with regional
organizations, is essential. Nevertheless, we must not
forget the responsibility of States, the first ones called
upon to develop policies and actions for the building of
peaceful and inclusive, resilient and cohesive societies,
with the rule of law, solid institutions and policies
oriented towards sustainable development, in line with
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the
Sustainable Development Goals, which contribute to
conflict prevention

====================

Similarly, we support efforts to strengthen the links
between the Human Rights Council and the Security
Council for early warning and action in situations of
risk of atrocities, thereby avoiding additional painful
cases of inaction or late response to serious crises. At
the same time, we reiterate that collective actions based
on the responsibility to protect must go hand in hand
with reliable and timely information, so that decisions
are accountable, transparent and are guided by a single
objective — the ethical imperative to protect individuals

delivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only

====================

They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member
of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506
(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official
Document System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org)

====================

and groups from the four atrocity crimes covered under
the responsibility to protect. We therefore support the
work of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General
on the Prevention of Genocide, Mr. Adama Dieng, and
the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the
Responsibility to Protect, Ms. Karen Smith

====================

In conclusion, we wish to emphasize that the joint
work of the United Nations and the strengthening
of multilateralism are the most effective tools for
maintaining international order, peace and security.
