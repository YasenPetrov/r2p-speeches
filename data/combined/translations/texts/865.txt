While we are having this
serious debate for the first time in a decade on an issue
that is important to all of us, we have seen one delegation
yet again misuse this platform to make an unwarranted
reference to the situation in the Indian state of Jammu
and Kashmir. Such cynical attempts have failed in the
past and have no support in this body

====================

I would like to place it on record and reiterate that
the state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and
inalienable part of India. No amount of empty rhetoric
from Pakistan will change that reality.
