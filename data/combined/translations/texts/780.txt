Liechtenstein welcomes
the third formal debate of the General Assembly on the
responsibility to protect (R2P) and aligns itself with the
statement delivered by the representative of Denmark
on behalf of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility
to Protect (see A/73/PV.93). The agreement on the
responsibility to protect is one of the most important
achievements of the 2005 World Summit. Liechtenstein
continues to be fully committed to the R2P norm and
consistently supports measures to further improve
its operationalization

====================

The concept of R2P enjoys broad political
support but much remains to be done in practice. The
responsibility of each State to protect its population
from mass atrocities is uncontested. However, in
committing to the R2P norm, we have also collectively
agreed on a joint obligation when the authorities are
unable or unwilling to live up to that responsibility. R2P
can be implemented through a wide range of measures,
from diplomatic engagement to more vigorous action,
including that taken by the Security Council. As the
situations in Myanmar, Syria and Yemen prove, all too
often the responsibility to protect continues to be elusive
in practice. We have been observing the inability of the
Council to do its work with increasing frustration

====================

In an important commitment to improving the
performance of the Security Council, 119 States
have signed up to the Accountability, Coherence and
Transparency group code of conduct on mass atrocities

====================

They thereby commit to taking measures to end or
prevent atrocity crimes when serving on the Council
and not to vote against credible draft resolutions
put forward to that effect. The code of conduct is an
essential political commitment that can change the

political culture in the Council when faced with the
risk or occurrence of atrocity crimes. Despite the
strong support for the code of conduct, the use of the
veto has significantly increased in recent years, in most
cases preventing Security Council action in response to
mass atrocities

====================

Liechtenstein supports the strong and active role
of the General Assembly, in particular where the
Security Council fails to address atrocity crimes in
accordance with its mandate pursuant to the Charter
of the United Nations. The International, Impartial and
Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation
and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most
Serious Crimes under International Law Committed
in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011 is a
positive example of the General Assemblyâ€™s potential
in that regard. Liechtenstein is also of the principled
view that any veto cast in the Security Council should
automatically be discussed in the General Assembly,
independent of the subject matter and without prejudice
to the outcome of such a discussion. We are pleased to
see that such an approach has met with interest among
the membership

====================

Liechtenstein agrees with the Secretary-General
that a stronger focus on prevention is necessary. We very
much welcome his new strategy against hate speech,
which can trigger and sustain a spiral of escalation
and violence that may result in atrocity crimes. Under
pillar I of the responsibility to protect, States have a
clear responsibility to act preventively against such
developments. A vocal stance against hate speech by
political leaders can send a strong message to that end

====================

In addition, States must promote and make full
use of the rule of law when mass atrocity crimes are
committed. Criminal accountability for mass atrocities
is of paramount importance in order to break recurring
cycles of violence and deter the commission of future
crimes. The International Criminal Court can play
a direct role in having an impact with respect to
preventing mass atrocity crimes from occurring. We
will continue to support the Court and its important
work, including by promoting the universality of the
Rome Statute.
