General Assembly Debate Statement: Russian Federation
Unofficial Transcription from webcast
Thank you Moderator,
Russia reaffirms its commitment to political obligations to protect populations against
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity in the context of
what was agreed at the 2005 Summit. It is our belief that the paramount obligation for
protecting the responsibility of one’s own population lies with the state. The role of the
international community amounts, first and foremost, to providing the necessary
assistance to the state in implementing this duty

====================

Using coercive measures is an extreme measure which should be implemented in strict
compliance with the UN Charter, in so doing the main aim of such coercion should be to
prompt the responsible state for implementing its obligations and not supplanting its role
in so doing

====================

The Secretary-General’s report contains interesting ideas and proposals with respect to
launching the instruments in Chapter VI, on pacific settlement of disputes, and Chapter
VIII, regional arrangements of the United Nations Charter. In order to implement
Responsibility to Protect, we agree with the conclusion that priorities should be given to
strengthening preventive mechanisms allowing one at an early stage to highlight/detect
problematic situations and prevent large scale atrocities

====================

The third pillar of R2P, especially with respect to the use of armed force, is the most
contradictory. Examples from practice confirm how likely the use or the application of
R2P may be for distorted goals. And in this context with this in mind the Libyan issue not
only didn’t reinforce faith in R2P but also harmed the image of this concept around the
world. Once again we appeal for there to be an extremely cautious approach to
implementing R2P. If there is interference, negative consequences may eviscerate the
chances of a positive effect. And in this context we note the timeliness of the Brazilian
idea on the Responsibility while Protecting

====================

Moderator, we are seeing too much distraction with regards to the structure of R2P, very
often we hear judgments about the relationship between the various components, the
various pillars of R2P. While the sequence should be for applying the principle, does this
exist in general? And so on and so forth. We’ve heard from the Secretary-General about
the simultaneous application of all three pillars. Or the application of these principles and
these pillars in different combinations and permutations. In respect of the same situation
we think that all of these judgments distract us from a very useful discuss about the real
problems of the Responsibility to Protect. And here there are still serious differences of
opinion. The question remains open of whether the proposed strategy for applying R2P
actually enjoys widespread recognition among states. Has the concept achieved the level
of maturity in general which would allow one without any doubt to put it into practice?
Have the mechanisms been created which limit the possibilities of abuse? We do not have

the confidence that in the world a consensus has been achieved on these issues. And only
such a consensus, in our opinion, would create a sound basis for further steps in this area

====================

We are ready to continue our discussion of these issues in the General Assembly of the
United Nations

====================

Thank you Sir
