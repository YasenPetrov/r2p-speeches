PERMANENT MISSION OF FRANCE TO THE UNITED NATIONS
245 EAST 47TH STREET, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017 TEL. (212) 702-4900 I thank the President of the General Assembly for organizing this
informal interactive dialogue, and the Secretary General for his report. We
agree with all of your recommendations, including the formalization
this dialogue through a specific point on the agenda of

the general Assembly

====================

France is in line with the statements given respectively
the European Union and the Netherlands, on behalf of the Group of Friends of R2P. AT

national title, I will present three observations

====================

First, we welcome the approach taken by the report consisting of
put the instruments of human rights at the heart of crime prevention
the most heinous. The General Assembly and the Security Council have progressed
recent years to better implement their responsibility in
preventing conflict and atrocities. We combine more in our work the
High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special Rapporteurs. The board
Security has unanimously twice, reaffirming the early warning role
Special Advisers to the prevention of genocide and responsibility
protect. We are doing more civil society participation in our meetings. The
protection of civilians is now the priority of many peacekeeping operations
Peace. These are positive steps that allow us to be better informed and
to assist states to assume their responsibility to protect. In CAR, Mali and

Iraq, it is the governments who we have asked to intervene. However, we can not help a state whose policy is
specifically to commit atrocities against its population. This does not relieve us
not mean our responsibility and abilities of action. Our
responsibility remains. Faced with these situations, coercive measures are
necessary to compel a government to protect its population. The
sanctions, commissions of inquiry and referral to the International Criminal Court
are essential instruments of deterrence. And, in certain circumstances, our

Collective responsibility is to use force to stop the killings

====================

Finally, we need to act. When mass atrocities are
committed, the Board should not add to the failure of prevention, that of
inaction. In Syria, four double-vetoes did not allow us to take
and preventive measures necessary to end the impunity of perpetrators of these
crimes. This is why France is working with its partners to
framing the use of the veto in cases of massive crimes, commitment
voluntary and collective permanent members. France will organize the

Mexico events on this initiative during the ministerial week
