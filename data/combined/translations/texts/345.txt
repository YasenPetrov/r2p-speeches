Mr. Chairman,

We take note of the progress report of the Secretary-General for
the concept of the responsibility to protect. As with previous reports
We viewed it through the prism of the relevant section of the Outcome
2005 Summit document, which sets out only on
today recognized the scope of the concept
Responsibility to Protect

====================

The report contains a number, in our opinion, correct and
timely ideas. In particular, according to the thesis of the special role
preventive measures in the implementation of the Responsibility to Protect

====================

Also share the understanding that the harm from rash and hasty
military action could significantly exceed the declared

Positive results. 2

However, the document has a number of questions. As is the case with
previous reports, we are concerned about attempts
to introduce in the UN to refer to turnover, ethnic genocide
cleansing, war crimes, crimes against humanity
general term "brutal crimes" (so-called "amosyu sgipez"),
which is not known to international law and could lead to
artificially expand the scope of application of the concept
Responsibility to Protect

====================

Worryingly continues to Projection
Reports from the concept of country-specific subjects. Thus, in
It describes a Libyan plot that once fed
by many as the first case of the practical application of the concept
the responsibility to protect. We all know that the use of force in
against the country, carried out under the pretext of protecting
population, as a result of long plunged it into chaos and
instability. It echoes similar to the current
migration crisis in the Mediterranean will be a long time
remind yourself. Report, however, does not give an adequate assessment
happened. All effects are charged to "lack of
proper support after the intervention. " The fact that as a result of
military intervention occurred dismantling of all state
system of the country, the authors of the document shall be disregarded

====================

Incidentally, has repeatedly stated in the document of the Secretary General,

that the intervention in Libya was authorized by the Council 3

Security. In this connection we would like to remind once again that
The Russian Federation considers the bombing in Libya
goes beyond what is permitted and not Resolution 1973
consistent with its goals

====================

We would like to briefly touch on some other points

====================

The report includes a call for universal ratification of the Statute
International Criminal Court. We note, however, that the Court has not yet
He proved to be an effective tool in preventing
violence and serious crime. We paid attention to
an expansion in the number of cases, the interpretation of the mandates of the HRC and UVKICH

====================

Separately want to stay on a mention in the strategy report
"Rights - this is important" ( "125 ir YAOP?"). This intra-Secretariat
initiative. It was developed without consultation with States
members and without their participation. T States countries have very poor
information on the specific results of its implementation. In this regard,
positive assessment of the strategy in the report in the context of

responsibility to protect premature

====================

""

The same conclusion is with respect to network
focal points for the prevention of genocide,
is a private initiative of a group of states. It is difficult
Judge how effectively it helps to prevent
genocide and other serious crimes under international

law. 4

The call addressed to the permanent members of the Council
Security, "self-restraint" in the use of the veto, on the
We believe that the report goes beyond the mandate. Veto -
an important part of the UN Charter. Security Council practice of giving
many examples of the stimulating and regulating effects
this institution, providing a truly collegial nature
the work of the Security Council

====================

In general terms the document in question proves
charted in the recent trend in which
a progress report on the responsibility to protect in many ways
repeats previous and becoming more academic
character. This is not surprising, because all aspects of the responsibility
protection over the years in the reports of the Secretary General were covered. In this
Communication should once again consider whether there is added value in
the proposal to include the question of the responsibility to protect in
the official agenda of the General Assembly. It is already so overloaded
in technical, academic and highly specialized
character

====================

Thank you, Mr. President.
