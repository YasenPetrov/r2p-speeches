(spoke in French): Canada
thanks the President of the General Assembly and
the Secretary-General for their statements (see A/72/
PV.99), and Australia and Ghana for their leadership
in including the responsibility to protect on the
agenda of the General Assembly. The inclusion of

the responsibility to protect on the formal agenda of
the General Assembly provides an opportunity to
reflect on our shared responsibility in preventing mass
atrocity crimes

====================

We welcome the recommendations contained in
the report of the Secretary-General (A/72/884). We
also wish to underscore the work accomplished by
the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the
Prevention of Genocide, Mr. Dieng, and the former
Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect,
Mr. Šimonović, in mainstreaming atrocity prevention
within the United Nations system. Given our shared
priority for prevention, we hope that a Special Adviser
on the Responsibility to Protect will soon be appointed

====================

(spoke in English)
At the 2005 World Summit, Heads of State and
Government committed to preventing international
atrocity crimes by adopting the key principles that
underpin the responsibility to protect. Despite the robust
normative framework that has been developed over the
years to protect populations from grievous harm, as we
speak, 65.6 million people, a large proportion of whom
are children, are forcibly displaced around the world. In
Syria, Yemen, Myanmar and South Sudan, to name just
a few country-specific situations, millions are seeking
protection and the preservation of their livelihoods
and basic human dignity. As noted in the SecretaryGeneral’s report on the responsibility to protect,
the overall trend since 2005 is a tenfold increase in
civilian deaths

====================

Numbers matter, but so do the stories behind the
numbers. Behind every death is a genuine human
tragedy for an individual, a family and community

====================

Those left behind are left to cope with deep trauma
for which no statistics can account. In addition, illegal
attacks on civilians, civilian infrastructure, health
care and medical and humanitarian personnel and the
denial of life-saving humanitarian assistance leave
wide-ranging and cumulative scars

====================

The multilateral and rules-based international order
that binds us together requires our sustained support
more than ever. Respect for international human rights
law and international humanitarian law is essential to
safeguarding humankind. If we are to prevent atrocity
crimes, we must understand and implement the lessons
of the past. We can do far more to prevent conflict,
including by building State capacities for early warning,
conflict analysis, dispute resolution and mediation

====================

States that invest in inclusivity and cohesion, allow
civil society to thrive and welcome civil-society voices
benefit from increased stability and diversity. However,
there are troubling instances where Member States
seek to constrain the voices of civil society, including
within the United Nations itself. States with effective,
accountable institutions are among the best defenders
of human rights

====================

Canada supports the renewed focus of the United
Nations on prevention and champions the values
of inclusive and accountable governance, peaceful
pluralism, gender equality and human rights. We
believe that inclusive national ownership can reduce the
stresses that may lead to conflict and can help to build
resilience and prevent internal crises from escalating
and engulfing countries and regions

====================

Canada believes that women play an integral role
in building a culture of prevention. We are committed
to promoting the full, active and equal participation
of women in conflict prevention, resolution and postconflict State-building

====================

If prevention fails, the response should be a
collective one. The Security Council has a specific
responsibility to ensure that early warning leads to
appropriate responses. There is a humanitarian cost
to inaction or to inadequate actions. It is essential that
the Security Council come together to take appropriate
action when atrocity risks emerge. In that regard, we
encourage more regular briefings to the Council by the
Special Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide and on
the Responsibility to Protect and by the United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights

====================

Canada is proud of the leadership role it has
played in establishing the International Criminal Court
(ICC), which will celebrate its twentieth anniversary
in July. Canada remains a strong supporter of and
advocate for the ICC and shares the values that it stands
for — fighting impunity and ensuring that victims of
the most serious international crimes have a path to
justice and accountability

====================

We have a strong normative framework aimed
at improving our collective approach and capacity to
protect civilians. We remain committed to preventive
actions and urge States to uphold their obligations
under international human rights, humanitarian and
refugee law, which underpin our commitment to the
responsibility to protect.
