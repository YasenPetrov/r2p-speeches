Israel voted against resolution
73/304 today, and we wish to explain our vote

====================

To be clear, the State of Israel wholeheartedly
condemns torture and is a party to the Convention
against Torture and fully committed to its dictates. Our
vote today does not derogate from our commitment in
any way. Our opposition to the resolution arises from
many similar concerns raised by our colleagues. In the
interest of time, I will outline those briefly

====================

Like our Singaporean colleagues and others, we
are deeply concerned about the potential implications

for trade and the open-ended scope of the resolution,
which could potentially include dual-use items,
particularly in its operative paragraphs. We also have
serious concerns with regard to whether the General
Assembly is the proper forum to discuss these matters,
and we are concerned about precedent-setting. We are
also concerned about the proposed group of experts. At
a very minimum, we would have liked to see a clear
requirement that they possess expertise in both human
rights and international trade

====================

The State of Israel was actively engaged in the few
informal consultations that were held, and we offered
constructive and concrete proposals to address many
of the concerns that we and others raised today and
in those consultations. We were disappointed that our
suggestions were not adequately reflected in the final
text. Therefore, despite our clear and unwavering
position condemning torture, we could not support
this initiative

====================

At the outset, we want to
thank the President for organizing this second annual
debate and the inclusion of this topic on the formal
agenda of the General Assembly. We also wish to thank
the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. António
Guterres, for his report on this important topic
(A/73/898). We welcome the appointment of a Special
Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Responsibility
to Protect (R2P), Ms. Karen Smith, and we support her
work and the important work of the Special Adviser to
Prevent Genocide, Mr. Adama Dieng

====================

As we watch global events unfold from the Middle
East to Latin America and witness atrocities committed
daily throughout the world, we are reminded each and
every day of the importance of preventing genocide,
war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity. We must all do our best. We must all do more,
individually and as a global community to ensure that
civilians receive the protection they need and deserve

====================

Two days ago, in the informal meeting of the
plenary on “Combating Anti-Semitism and Other
Forms of Racism and Hate – The Challenges of
Teaching Tolerance and Respect in the Digital Age”, we
heard in speech after speech the words “never again”

====================

It is our hope as a people who have suffered from
some of history’s greatest atrocities and who continue
to face daily and concrete threats of annihilation that
this is not mere lip service, and that we all uphold the
important principle of the responsibility to protect. In
this regard, we thank the Secretary-General for his call
to guarantee non-recurrence and for early action and, in
particular, for his concrete recommendations to prevent
hate speech

====================

The State of Israel welcomes the Secretary-General’s
emphasis on the first pillar of the responsibilityto-protect doctrine, namely, the responsibility of
individual States to protect their own populations

from the gravest crimes. We wholeheartedly agree
with and embrace the Secretary-General’s important
message that the responsibility to protect starts first
and foremost at home

====================

On that front, Israel has adopted a long list of
educational and legislative measures to ensure the
protection of all of its citizens, regardless of their race,
religion or ethnicity. For example, Israel has a longstanding educational policy to both teach and learn from
the lessons of the past, with comprehensive Holocaust
remembrance educational programmes

====================

In line with the Secretary-General’s call to
embrace diversity, the State of Israel has adopted policy
and legislative measures to prevent discrimination
and ensure diversity in the workplace. Our President
has also advanced a national campaign to promote
tolerance and coexistence among the various sectors
of our society. Consistent with the Secretary-General’s
recommendation for implementing measures to ensure
accountability and the rule of law, Israel also has
undertaken major efforts in recent years, spearheaded
by the second Turkel Commission, which was headed
by a former Supreme Court Justice and joined by
international observers, to review and strengthen
Israel’s internal accountability and investigation
mechanisms. These reforms are ongoing

====================

Israel is also committed to sharing its experience
and knowledge to further the doctrine of R2P abroad

====================

We have worked in conjunction with United Nations
bodies to assist post-conflict countries in building
and strengthening their judicial institutions and the
local rule of law. We are exploring options to expand
these efforts along with partner nations here at the
United Nations

====================

As we stated last year, Israel is and remains fully
committed to the prevention of genocide and mass

atrocities (see A/72/PV.100). In 2005, we joined the
consensus on the World Summit outcome document
(resolution 60/1) which embraced and promoted the R2P
principle, and we continue to support this document. At
the same time, from a legal point of view, we wish to
note again that it is our view that this doctrine does
not create novel legal norms or obligations. Rather,
we believe that the responsibility to protect should be
construed and applied within existing legal frameworks

====================

As this is an emerging doctrine, we wish to stress yet
again that in order to be more effective and adequately
address the most acute crises and tragedies facing the
world, the principle of R2P must also address the role
and responsibility of non-State actors and terrorist
groups that commit atrocities, blatantly disregarding
international law. Moreover, we believe that the R2P
doctrine should be applied only in the most extreme
situations involving mass atrocities, ethnic cleansing
or genocide

====================

As the nation-State of the Jewish people and
the victims of many of history’s darkest hours, we
fully embrace the call to protect civilians from mass
atrocities wherever they may be occurring. We must all
play a part as a global community, both domestically
and internationally, to ensure that we are doing our
utmost to protect innocent civilians. The responsibility
to protect cannot be mere words on paper or slogans. It
must be translated to real concrete action. More must be
done to ensure real and lasting peace and security for
all and the protection of innocent civilians worldwide.
