General Assembly informal interactive dialogue on the Report of the Secretary-General
on the Responsibility to Protect

The responsibility to protect and accountability for prevention

Statement of the Republic of Croatia
6 September 2017, New York

Mr. President,

Let me begin by strongly welcoming the holding of the interactive dialogue on the
Responsibility to Protect for the ninth year ina row

====================

While aligning with the EU statement, I would like to thank the Secretary-General,
Mr. Guterres, and the Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect, Mr

====================

Simonovi¢ for their continuing efforts in keeping R2P high on our agenda. After
more than a decade since the initiation of the concept, the time has come to step
up our joint efforts and rethink our commitments for truly delivering on the
promise of “Never again.”

Over the last two years, the world has continued to witness the consequences of
the violations of human rights, international humanitarian law and the lack of
governments’ accountability. The biggest refugee crisis since the Second World
War, affecting many countries, serves as a telling example of unsuccessful atrocity
prevention with an international implication, spreading well over regional
boundaries. We try to respond to these crises reactively, generating great human
and financial cost to everyone involved. Yet, we continuously fail to use the
opportunities to prevent and timely address atrocity crimes and protect
vulnerable populations

====================

In societies where human rights violations already happened, we advocate for an
inclusive and nationally owned process of transitional justice that can be
instrumental in reducing the risks of relapsing into conflict. In this context, we see
a fundamental value of the new Peacebuilding Architecture, contributing to the
commitment and responsibility to building national capabilities and resilient
societies in conflict-affected states

====================

Putting our national commitments towards the concept into practice, Croatia has
appointed an R2P Focal point at a senior level, and calls on other countries to do
the same. Our unwavering support is also reflected in the decision to integrate a
module on R2P in the curricular program of educating future generations of our
diplomats. As mentioned on many previous occasions, Croatia strongly welcomes the joint
French-Mexican initiative, as well as the ACT initiative of adopting the Code of
Conduct for the responsible use of the veto in the Security Council, and remains a
staunch supporter of the work of the International Criminal Court

====================

As a current member of the Human Rights Council, Croatia will encourage the
strengthening of early warning and early action mechanisms, as well as tighter
links between HRC and the Security Council. In addition, we support the increased
willingness of the international community to take collective action through the
Security Council in occasions of manifest failures of national authorities’ to
protect their populations from violations of human rights

====================

In this sense, please be assured that Croatia remains fully committed to assigning
the greatest priority to this valuable principle through applying and making the
most of a wide scope of our political, diplomatic and humanitarian tools, as well
as our network of global partners

====================

Thank you.
