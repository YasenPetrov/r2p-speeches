Statement delivered by the Delegation of Nigeria to the United Nations, at the United
Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion "From commitment to
implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened by the President
of the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
25 February 2016
Nigeria notes that, 10 years after the adoption of the WSOD, It is critical that the General
Assembly pronounce itself on Responsibility to Protect by adopting since a resolution was
adopted in 2009. Given ongoing atrocities around the world, including terrorist actions by
NSAs, as indicated by Edward Luck, it is important for member States to reaffirm their core
commitment reached at the 2005 World Summit

====================

Nigeria welcomes the draft resolution on the Responsibility to Protect and affirms support for
its balanced nature and focus on strengthening national capacities for prevention, as
highlighted by Jennifer Welsh, this is the core of the Responsibility to Protect

====================

We also call on the General Assembly to adopt the draft resolution by consensus in the first
half of 2016. Nigeria sees this as an opportunity to reaffirm the importance of Geneva based
institutions and mechanisms, such as the HRC and the OHCHR in moving forward the
Responsibility to Protect agenda. We also stress the essence of the UPR processes and
special procedures mandate order and early warning for the prevention of mass atrocity
crimes. In this regard, we note the importance of the links between Geneva and New York

====================

We also support the work of the UN Secretariat regarding the ‘Human Rights up Front’ action
plan and system wide efforts put in place to improve the capacity in preventing and responding
to serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law including those that
lead to mass atrocity crimes

====================

The original policy forum on Responsibility to Protect, held in Abuja, Nigeria, from 11 to 12
June 2012, highlighted, among other issues, strategies to encourage political will and
cooperation among member States regarding Responsibility to Protect and the need for
effective national and regional mechanisms for dealing with perpetrators of mass atrocities

====================

Relevant here, is the endorsement of the SG for the appointment of Responsibility to Protect
Focal Points as tangible demonstration of commitment to the prevention of mass atrocity
crimes. We therefore encourage all member States and regional organizations to become part
of this growing global network as Nigeria reaffirms its commitment to the Responsibility to
Protect and the need to prioritize the prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and
crimes against humanity, as contained in paragraphs 138 and 138 of the 2005 WSOD

====================

In conclusion, we call on all member of the Security Council not to vote against or block
credible action aimed at preventing mass atrocity crimes. We support the ACT group’s Code
of Conduct regarding Security Council action against genocide, crimes against humanity or
war crimes which has received 110 signatures of support, to date, as well as the FrenchMexican initiative on voluntary restraint on the use of the veto in mass atrocity situations

====================

In addition, we express strong support for the work of the Special Advisor on the Prevention
of Genocide and Responsibility to Protect and reaffirm the importance of the framework of
analysis for atrocity crimes

====================

Finally, Nigeria joins others in supporting the inclusion of Responsibility to Protect on the
formal agenda of the 71st session of the General Assembly
