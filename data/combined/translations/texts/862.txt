Bangladesh considers
this formal debate in the General Assembly on the
responsibility to protect an important development. We
are encouraged to see the list of speakers and level of

participation at this debate and hope that its continued
momentum will help to clarify and demystify certain
issues concerning the responsibility to protect. We see
merit in having this as a standing item on the agenda of
the General Assembly

====================

Bangladesh aligns itself with the statement
delivered by the representative of Qatar on behalf of the
Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect (see
A/72/PV.99). We thank the President of the General
Assembly and the Secretary-General for their hardhitting and forward-looking statements

====================

Bangladesh reaffirms its commitment to the
responsibility to protect as expressed and adopted
in the 2005 World Summit. We consider the three
pillars of the responsibility to protect to constitute
its core foundation and remain sensitized to concerns
among a number of Member States about the possible
ramifications of the third pillar in particular. We do not
consider that principled opposition to the third pillar
can take us forward in any way unless we make an effort
to reconcile it as part of the responsibility-to-protect
architecture with the necessary understandings and
safeguards built around it. We would urge all Member
States to approach the issue in that constructive spirit

====================

We underscore that States have the primary
responsibility to protect and that it should not be
asserted to contravene the fundamental principle of
State sovereignty. The prerogative of States to maintain
and enforce law and order and protect their citizens
must be founded on a nationally determined legal
basis, in adherence to relevant international norms and
standards. However, in cases where a State appears
unable or unwilling to assume the responsibility to
protect, the international community cannot simply
ignore the situation and relegate it to the domain of
internal or bilateral affairs. The United Nations in
particular has a role to play in this context, in the light
of the purposes and principles of its Charter

====================

We therefore endorse the Secretary-General’s vision
of making the prevention of atrocities the centrepiece of
his prevention agenda. The various forms of atrocities,
such as genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity
and ethnic cleansing, that we continue to witness
around the world reinforce the urgency of the task at
hand. There is a near-convergence of views that the
United Nations has the scope to further step up its
efforts in preventing and responding to the commission

of atrocity crimes and in making a difference on the
ground through early warning and preventive action

====================

of its possible jurisdiction on the forced deportation of
the Rohingya is shrouded in uncertainty

====================

At this point, our delegation would like to turn to
the Rohingya humanitarian crisis, which Bangladesh
has been forced yet again to deal with since October
2016 and August 2017. The magnitude of the atrocities
involved in the crisis has shaken the world’s conscience,
and the Secretary-General has duly taken the lead in
directing the international community’s attention to this
long-term threat to regional and international security

====================

The atrocities against the Rohingya committed
in the name of counter-terrorism operations, which
have resulted in the exodus of more than 700,000
people, clearly amounted to a State’s abdication of its
responsibility to protect civilians on its territory. In her
address to the General Assembly in September 2017 (see
A/72/PV.14), our Prime Minister therefore suggested
creating safe zones in Rakhine state to ensure protection
for the vulnerable Rohingya and other communities
there. In order to address the Rohingya’s overriding
concerns about their safety and security, we continue to
advocate for a mechanism to guarantee their protection,
especially given the environment of near-impunity for
the crimes they have recently been subjected to

====================

The crisis was long in the making, and the apathy
or complacency of the concerned international and
regional actors largely allowed it to reach its current
proportions. It has been particularly disappointing to
note the sheer inadequacy of early-warning messages
from the United Nations presence in Myanmar even
when preparations were reportedly under way for the
atrocities committed by Myanmar security forces
and local vigilantes in Rakhine state last year. Such
inadequacies and omissions have enabled the Myanmar
civilian and military authorities to peddle their
fabricated and toxic narratives about the Rohingya in
the direction of outright denial or the legitimization of
any wrongdoing, let alone admitting to atrocities

====================

We hope that the recently created possibilities
for United Nations engagement in Rakhine state will
be used for the dual purpose of, first, preventing any
further violence against the remaining Rohingya
population, and secondly, creating a situation conducive
to the voluntary, safe and dignified return of the forcibly
displaced Rohingya in Bangladesh to their homes or
places of choice in Rakhine state. That could be coupled
with efforts to support the development of appropriate
legal and institutional mechanisms for preventing
atrocities at the national level in Myanmar. This is an
opportunity to replicate or adapt good practices already
in place in a host of Member States, including some in
the region

====================

In the process, the critical question of accountability
for the atrocity crimes committed against the Rohingya,
including against women and children, must remain at
the fore. The national investigation initiatives launched
by Myanmar authorities have so far failed to gain any
credence, and the Human Rights Council’s fact-finding
mission has repeatedly been denied access. According
to reports, the International Criminal Court’s most
recent overture to Myanmar to engage on the question

Following his visit to the Rohingya camps in Cox’s
Bazar earlier this year, the Secretary-General’s Special
Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide commented on
the responsibility to protect in action in Bangladesh

====================

He went back to Bangladesh last week to discuss the
possible role of religious leaders in addressing any
fallout from the crisis at the community level

====================

In tandem with our sustained and progressive
efforts at the national level, Bangladesh will continue
to uphold international humanitarian and human rights
law as part of our contribution to United Nations
peace operations. We reaffirmed these pledges during
our recently concluded Universal Periodic Review
at the Human Rights Council. We remain committed
to promoting the universalization of the Convention
on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide and the Rome Statute of the International
Criminal Court

====================

Considering the importance of reconciling with the
past, we seek the international community’s support
in recognizing the genocide committed in Bangladesh
during our War of Liberation in 1971. We look forward
to making an announcement soon on our decision to
join the code of conduct regarding Security Council
action against genocide, crimes against humanity and
war crimes, which we support in principle.
