STATEMENT
by the delegation of Kazakhstan to the UN at the informal interactive
dialogue of the UNGA on “Responsibility to Protect”
(6 September 2017, New York)
Mr. President,
Secretary-General,
I would like to thank the President of the General Assembly for convening
this important meeting and the distinguished panelists for their valuable insights

====================

We appreciate the efforts of Special Advisers, Mr. Adama Dieng and Mr. Ivan
Simonovic to enhance the UN’s capacity to fulfill this mandate, as well as the awareness
raising campaign of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect

====================

We welcome the report of Secretary-General Guterres and fully support his view to
rebalance the approach between peace and security by making prevention a priority

====================

Kazakhstan as a non-permanent member on the Security Council considers it a moral
imperative to protect populations from atrocities. Committed to this objective, we,
therefore, have joined the ACT Group’s Code of Conduct regarding Security Council
action against genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes

====================

Kazakhstan supports the concept of Responsibility to Protect and its three reinforcing
pillars. We believe that prevention by a comprehensive series of diplomatic actions,
conflict resolution based on equal responsibility for peace and security, mutual respect
and non-interference into domestic affairs are crucial to ensure the protection of civilians

====================

Tackling the root causes of conflict, including chronic poverty, illiteracy, food insecurity
and climate change, are equally important. We also need to invest in a sustainable world
with basic services and protected human rights by helping Member States with capacity
building for more effective and accountable institutions, appropriate legislation, security
and justice reform, ending all impunity and enhancing personnel competence

====================

Our efforts could be thwarted by the inability of the international community to reach
agreement on what constitutes R2P, with contradictory concepts between the right to
sovereignty and territorial integrity versus the use of force. This divergence is due to
different historical and political backgrounds and considerations of the Member States on
this issue. Yet it is acknowledged that the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty
should be accompanied by the obligation of states to fulfil their legal, moral and political
responsibilities with greater oversight by regional organizations

====================

Thus, it is necessary to define accurate criteria and create impartial, balanced,
objective and depoliticized mechanisms of decision-making in respect to the application
of the RtoP pillars and principles and applying them in sequence. The use of force should

2

be a last resort measure, duly approved by the UN Security Council directed at state and
non-state actors

====================

Peacekeepers play an important role in the protection of civilians. Therefore, it is of
vital importance that the UN political offices and peacekeeping operations have precise
mandates and structures, with highly qualified and specially trained personnel, with state
of-the-art equipment. These have to be reinforced by multidimensional provisions for each
of the vulnerable groups, especially women and children. At the same time, experience
has proved that UN peacekeeping operations are not sufficiently equipped to fight militias
and terrorist organizations in cases of asymmetrical conflicts, all of which require constant
vigilance and monitoring

====================

Kazakhstan is committed to work closely with all relevant parties to ensure the full
protection of populations from atrocities, and guaranteeing safety and security – the pivots
for the right to development, which are some of the key priorities of the UN

====================

Thank you, Mr. President

====================
