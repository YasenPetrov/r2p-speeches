To the interactive dialogue in the UN General Assembly on
"Responsibility to protect" 5.09.2012 g

====================

- Russia confirms its commitment to the political
obligations

by

protection

the population

from

genocide

military

crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic
purges within the framework agreed at the 2005 summit

====================

We believe that the primary responsibility for
provide protection to their own population lies with States

====================

The role of the international community is reduced, first of all, to provide
necessary assistance to States in the implementation of this
duties. Appeal to the enforcement mechanisms for the implementation of
SCR is an extreme measure, which should be carried out in
strict accordance with the UN Charter. Thus the main purpose of such
coercion - to induce the responsible State to fulfill
their duties, and not its replacement in this role

====================

-

Report

Secretary General

It contains

interesting

ideas

and

proposals for engagement toolkit for Chapter
VI ( «Peaceful settlement of disputes") and Chapter VIII ( «Regional
Agreement "), the Charter of the United Nations for the purposes of the SCR. We agree with the conclusion
that priority should be given to strengthening the preventive
mechanisms to identify at an early stage problematic
situation and prevent large-scale atrocities

====================

2

- third component IPF, especially in military applications
force, is the most controversial. Case Studies
confirm how likely is the use of
postulates IPF in reverse order. In this sense, the Libyan
the plot not only strengthened the belief in the potential of the SCR, but also hurt
image

concept

at

world

====================

again

We call on

to

extremely

responsible handling tools IPF. When
the negative consequences of intervention may at times exceed
possible positive effect

====================

- There is excessive passion built around
SCR structure concept. You can often hear the argument that,
the correlation between the different components of SCR (pillars), what
sequence is implemented, if it exists at all
and

etc

====================

WITH

feed

Secretary General

talking

about

capabilities

simultaneous implementation of all three components simultaneously
or in various combinations in respect of one and the same situation

====================

It seems that all these arguments lead us away from
really useful discussion around issues relating to
It is an HMO. And there remain serious differences of
views

====================

3

- It remains an open question as to whether the proposed uses
implementation strategy HMO widely recognized states

====================

whether the concept has reached a whole to a level of maturity that
would allow no doubt put it into practice? established whether
mechanisms that limit opportunities for abuse? In
we are not sure that this consensus has developed in the world
issues. And only such a consensus, in our view, would create
solid basis for further steps in this area. Ready
to continue the discussion on this issue in the General
Assembly of the United Nations
