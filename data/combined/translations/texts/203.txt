Statement delivered by Fiji – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2016 
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST] 
 
Thank you, Mr. Moderator

====================

My delegation thanks the President of the General Assembly for convening this informal dialogue, and 
also thanks the Secretary General for his 8th report on “Mobilizing Collective Action – The Next Decade 
of the Responsibility to Protect”

====================

We echo the sentiments in the SG’s report that the necessity and relevance of the Responsibility to 
Protect is even stronger now in the face of the growing conflicts and crises in our world today. This 
need, of course, is to be complemented by political commitments and the framework for action to 
prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. This is the opportune 
moment to for us to take steps forward and to build further on articles 138 and 139 of the World 
Summit Outcome Document

====================

Fiji subscribes to the principles and purposes of the Responsibility to Protect. We emphasize the notion 
that it is the prime responsibility of the state to protect its population from atrocity crimes, and we call 
for the full implementation of all three pillars of the Responsibility to Protect

====================

As a small, island developing state, Fiji looks to the UN Security Council to fulfill its responsibility to 
maintain peace and security. We recognize the many challenges the Council faces in delivering on the 
responsibility. It is important, nevertheless, that the Council, together with member states and regional 
organizations, overcomes these challenges in the interest of timely and decisive response to atrocity 
crimes

====================

Through Fiji’s contribution to UN Peacekeeping operations, we maintain our commitment to global 
peace and security. We also reaffirm our commitment and support to global key institutions such as the 
International Criminal Court, to ensure accountability for atrocity crimes and avert their occurrence. The 
prevention of such crimes is always more desirable than resolving or addressing them

====================

We consider that the SG’s report outlines some very useful mechanisms. We welcome the proposals and 
initiatives by some members of the UN Security Council to convene situations or briefings as a means to 
respond to emerging risks at early stages of potential crises

====================

Mr. Moderator, on the national level we need to build greater harmony and community spirit among 
our citizens, regardless of race and religion. We recognize that these goals, amongst others on 
international and regional levels, cannot be achieved overnight and therefore require perseverance

====================

Indeed, there is no “one size fits all” framework for building a resilient society and we will continue to 
uphold the Responsibility to Protect our citizens. As our society calls, close attention will be paid to 
crimes that might threaten our peace and security
