Statement by Bangladesh at the Informal Interactive Dialogue on the
Responsibility to Protect on Wednesday, 06 September 2017
Mr. Chair,
We thank the Secretary General for his comprehensive report with specific
suggestions for strengthening accountability for prevention of mass atrocity
crimes

====================

Bangladesh supports the Secretary General’s clear-sighted approach to place
atrocity prevention as the centrepiece of his prevention agenda

====================

We see merit in his recommendation to include Responsibility to Protect in the
formal agenda of the General Assembly in order to have informed, threadbare
discussions on the conceptual and operational issues

====================

The interactive discussions this morning have been indicative of the possible
synergies and complementarities among the UN’s humanitarian response,
development and sustaining peace initiatives towards atrocity prevention. There
is evident scope for better utilizing the various human rights institutional
mechanisms for supporting evidence-based risk assessment, early warning and
mitigation measures

====================

We agree with the Secretary General that the Security Council should collectively
reflect on its role in atrocity prevention. As a troop contributing country,
Bangladesh underscores the importance of clear and achievable mandates for
protection of civilians by peacekeeping missions and the provision of
corresponding resources and capacity. We maintain our in-principle support for
possible suspension of veto in case of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and
crimes against humanity

====================

Bangladesh had set a pathway for ensuring justice for past atrocity crimes
through our national judicial process, pursuant to relevant international norms

====================

Our National Parliament passed a Resolution last year to delcare March 25th as
the Genocide Remembrance Day. Bangladesh seeks the international
community’s support in recognizing the genocide committed during our War of
1

Liberation, which would be a manifestation of the commitment to recognise past
and present atrocity crimes

====================

Right at this moment, Bangladesh is experiencing yet another massive influx of
displaced civilians from the Rakhine State in neighbouring Myanmar, causing a
serious humanitarian challenge. The Secretary General has expressed his deep
concern over the situation and urged the Security Council to send a clear message
to de-escalate tension and ensure humanitarian access to those in need. The
international community should join voices seeking the minimum guarantee of
protection and assistance for the affected civilians inside Myanmar. For the
medium to long term, the Kofi Annan Advisory Commission’s report contains
many useful recommendations where the international community can extend
support to the Government of Myanmar

====================

The responsibility to protect should have at least some assurance for those
desperately seeking refuge along our border
