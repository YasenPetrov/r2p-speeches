Statement delivered by Turkey â€“ Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2016
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]

Thank you, Mr. Moderator. We have aligned ourselves with the statement (by Luxembourg) and follow
with remarks within our national capacity. We thank the President of the General Assembly for organizing
this meeting

====================

The Responsibility to Protect has yet to become an established norm of international law, its scope and
application needs to be defined and developed. Yet, that the international community discusses the
application of this norm and seeks to accommodate the humanitarian need is encouraging. R2P
establishes a delicate balance between safeguarding humanitarian concerns and the respect for the
principle of national sovereignty. Therefore, a balanced proposal for the accommodation of the norms of
R2P and sovereignty become all the more important in order to achieve the widest consensus among the
membership. We believe that preventive policies and mediation efforts should have a prominent role in
this regard. We attach particular importance to preventive diplomacy, effectively for the peaceful
settlement of disputes

====================

Mr. Moderator, the legal definition of R2P should be based on the largest possible consent of the
international community. Scope and Parameters to apply also need to be determined. These tasks should
not be carried out by the quest to revisit or renegotiate the well-established principles of international
law, or the existent legal framework on the crimes of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity

====================

R2P is not only related to Chapter VII of the UN Charter, it is also a part of International Humanitarian and
Human Rights Law. Therefore, it could be applied with the close collaboration of the Security Council and
the General Assembly in a defined manner. In this context, we hope the discussions on R2P and its
application will help us pave the way for restricting the veto powers of permanent members of the
Security Council in matters related to crimes against humanity and crimes of genocide

====================

On the other hand, R2P should also take into account populations escaping from these crimes to
neighboring countries. In this framework, the scope of R2P should also cover the needs of populations,
such as refugees and asylum seekers, from the perspective of burden sharing
