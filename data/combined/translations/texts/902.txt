I have the honour to speak
on behalf of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. We also
align ourselves with the statement delivered earlier by
the observer of the European Union

====================

We strongly support holding a formal General
Assembly debate on the responsibility to protect, and
we are glad that this formal debate is taking place
today after nine years of informal discussions. The
implementation of the responsibility to protect is an
important topic that deserves to be a standing item on
the General Assembly’s agenda

====================

We thank the Secretary-General for his annual
report, which focuses on options to further improve
early warning and strengthen early action. The
report reminds us that the international community

continues to fall short in preventing atrocity crimes and
protecting vulnerable populations. We fully agree with
the Secretary-General in his summary that
“[i]t costs far more to pick up the pieces after crisis
than it does to prevent crisis.” (A/72/884, p.1)
With the help of available prevention tools, we must
better translate early-warning signs into timely
preventive action to avoid repeating the tragic mistakes
of the past. Massive failures in the responsibility to
protect are particularly glaring today as we mark
the seventieth anniversary of the Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide

====================

It is the primary responsibility of individual States to
protect all populations within their territory from mass
atrocity crimes. The timely identification of risks and
detection of early-warning signs of atrocity crimes can
help save lives through action. We note from the report
that some Member States and multilateral organizations
have strengthened those capacities over the past few
years. It is crucial to continue such preventive efforts,
including by developing and integrating early warning
into national policies and addressing the root causes of
risks. With strong national institutions, transparent and
accountable political leadership and respect for the rule
of law, efforts to prevent atrocity crimes can be more
effective. The protection of human rights is crucial to
the prevention of conflicts. Furthermore, systematic
human rights violations are often important warning
signs of potential crises. In that regard, regional and
international human rights mechanisms and their
recommendations can provide useful support to Member
States. Civil society, the media and journalists can also
positively contribute to developing early-warning and
response systems by raising public awareness about
human rights violations and crimes against humanity

====================

Timely action is a crucial component of the
responsibility to protect concept. We welcome the
inclusion of lessons learned in the report, as they
provide useful guidance on factors that could affect
effective early action. We also agree that actions taken
jointly by local, national, regional and global actors can
be more effective. Too often, however, States are not
willing or able to prevent or respond to mass atrocities

====================

It then is the international community’s duty to live
up to its responsibility to protect. The United Nations
system has a particular role to play in advancing and
operationalizing the concept of the responsibility to
protect, including through the protection of civilians

in peacekeeping operations. We would like to take this
opportunity to thank the previous Special Advisers on
the Responsibility to Protect for their hard work and
commitment, and we hope that the new Adviser will be
appointed soon

====================

The Security Council has a special responsibility to
take timely and decisive action to prevent the outbreak
of brutality against innocent people. Unfortunately,
on too many occasions, the right of the veto has been
abused and has left the Council paralysed. We therefore
support the proposal to voluntarily limit the use of the
veto at the Security Council in situations involving
mass atrocity crimes and in accordance with the code
of conduct requiring the members of the Council not to
vote against any action intended to stop or prevent mass
atrocity crimes

====================

We encourage the Secretary-General to continue
his good offices in bringing situations involving
the imminent risk of atrocity crimes to the attention
of the relevant regional and United Nations bodies,
including the Security Council. We emphasize the need
to ensure accountability for mass atrocity crimes. We
urge States to thoroughly investigate and prosecute
people responsible for the most serious crimes. Our
countries will continue to support the work of the
International Criminal Court (ICC), which is essential
to operationalizing the concept of the responsibility to
protect. Referrals to the ICC by the Security Council
are necessary when there is evidence that atrocity
crimes have been committed with impunity

====================

Exactly 100 years ago, Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania chose their path to building open,
democratic and inclusive societies based on cohesion,
multilateralism, equality, inclusion and the rule of law

====================

The path has not always been easy, and we treasure
what we have achieved. Today we remain committed to
the implementation of the responsibility to protect. We
call on all United Nations States Members to uphold
that important political commitment. We all must do
what we can to protect civilian populations from the
threat of atrocity crimes.
