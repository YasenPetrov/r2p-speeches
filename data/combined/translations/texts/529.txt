Mister President,

The debate that brings us together today has the sole purpose of saving lives
human. All here have embraced, in 2005, the responsibility to protect our
populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing of ct
crimes against humanity by adopting the Final Document of the 2005 Summit

====================

Four years later, the Government of Monaco welcomes favorably
report, balanced, submitted by the Secretary-General on the implementation of the
responsibility to protect and welcomes the evolution of this concept in recent
years

====================

In Celtic perspective, the Monaco Government supports based strategy
on three fundamental pillars:

- State responsibility for the protection,

- international assistance and capacity building

====================

- and finally, the resolute response from the international community if necessary

====================

Mister President,

As stated His Excellency Mr. Jean-Paul Proust, Minister of State
the Principality at the General Debate of the 60 ° "session of the General Assembly
United Nations, it is time to "work constructively so that the
responsibility to protect becomes as soon as possible of positive law "

====================

Monaco has always defended the concept of development-centered
human, can only support the establishment of a system of principles and
values ​​that promote the protection of people in situations
serious in the name of "non-indifference"

====================

In this regard, it might be wise. be inspired by the spirit of the Act
Constitutive of the African Union which recognizes the right to intervene in a State
member decision of the Assembly in respect of grave circumstances, while
respecting the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and respect
democratic principles, human rights, the rule of law and
good governance. The Independent International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty
States, for its part, helped define the responsibility to protect as
ability to prevent, react and rebuild the face of massive violations
human rights

====================

If, as the report rightly describes the Secretary-General, serious situations
are not limited to certain regions of the world, establishing an active partnership based
on a mutual engagement that takes into consideration the specifics of
each country seems to meet the expectations expressed by our Heads of State and
Government. In this way, the responsibility to protect strengthens States
Sovereign helping them to fulfill their obligations

====================

In looking forward to the proposals that will formulate the Secretary-General to
to improve the United Nations early warning system, my delegation wishes to you
ensure that it is willing to work with all Member States and to
mobilize to reach a consensus on this point

====================

Thank you for your attention.
