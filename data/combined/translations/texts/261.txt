Statement delivered by the Delegation of Belgium to the United Nations, at the United
Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion "From commitment to
implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened by the President
of the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
25 February 2016
We fully support the statements made by the European Union and by the Group of Friends on
Responsibility to Protect. Today’s discussion is extremely important to us, especially seeing
the recent events in Syria and abroad continue to show the dangerous realities of today

====================

We also support the transregional initiative to adopt a resolution on the 10th anniversary of the
WSOD. This draft resolution will include, in the General Assembly agenda, an item on
Responsibility to Protect which we believe is particularly important

====================

Other efforts trying to implement the tools that will prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity will lead to a much more effective and rapid response

====================

We feel that the initiative of Mexico and France to use restraint in the use of the veto as well
as the Code of Conduct of the ACT group when war crimes, crimes against humanity and war
crimes occur

====================

Belgium particularly appreciates the work of the Special Advisor for the Prevention of
Genocide and the Special Advisor on the Responsibility to Protect. We feel that the analysis
of atrocity crimes will better allow us to better evaluate the prevention these crimes. This, along
with the initiative ‘Human Rights up Front’ from the SG, will allow us to prevent these crimes
in the future

====================

Finally, we are convinced that the prevention of crimes will come from the swift prosecution of
crimes already committed. This is necessary for a reconstruction of a society as well. We call
on all member States to ratify the Rome Statute and to continue the essential work of the ICC
among other instruments

====================

We wish to note the work of the South-African government and the UN to create a Special
Criminal Court in the CAR. This will be essential in the CAR also because the international
experience of the judges in this court will be essential for reconstruction in the CAR. We call
on all States to support this initiative

====================
