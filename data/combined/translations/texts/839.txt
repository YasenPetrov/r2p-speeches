Let me start by thanking
the President for convening this meeting of the General
Assembly on the responsibility to protect and the
prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity

====================

Even though the General Assembly is holding
its first formal meeting since 2009, it has remained
seized of the matter, albeit in an informal manner

====================

My delegation was among those that preferred the
continuation of our discussion within the existing
framework, for we were not fully convinced of the
utility of a one-off formal meeting of the Assembly on
an issue that evokes such divergent viewpoints on its
nature, scope and application

====================

In any case, we believe that the onus should not
be on the modalities of our discussion but rather
on the substantive nature of the differences in our
perspectives and viewpoints. Or course, that view in
no way diminishes my country’s abiding commitment
to the safety and security of all our citizens. That is, in
fact, an obligation inherent in the nature of sovereignty
and national responsibility

====================

In recent days, the issue of protection has come
into a renewed global spotlight, in particular because
of the grave situation in occupied Palestine. It is also in
Palestine that the failure of the international community
to uphold those norms has been most manifest and
telling. Thus, as the killing fields of Gaza were drenched
in the blood of more than 130 innocent Palestinians,
including women and children, the Security Council
was a silent bystander to the plight of the long-suffering
Palestinian people. Even more disturbing, while the
safety and protection of Palestinian civilians throughout
the occupied territory is a right expressly recognized in
several Security Council resolutions, the Council failed
to reaffirm that right on 1 June. As we all know, as a
result, on 13 June the General Assembly had to step in
(see A/ES-10/PV.38) yet again to fill the void left by the
Security Council’s inaction

====================

The edifice of the responsibility to protect stands
on more tenuous ground today than ever before,
for decisions taken by the international community
have often failed the test of the highest standards of
objectivity and impartiality. That masquerade of
political expediency posing as high-flowing idealism

has meant that resultant actions have lacked the legal
and moral legitimacy to gain wider acceptability. After
all, if we are selective in our approach, expressing
indignation at some transgressions while choosing to
wilfully ignore others, any norm will quickly turn into
mere pretence

====================

Against that backdrop, calls for accountability
would invariably smack of double standards and
selectivity, especially when egregious crimes, including
killing and mass blinding, are being committed in full
view of the international community. Many of those
tragic victims, including in Indian-occupied Jammu
and Kashmir, have the further indignity of living
under foreign occupation, which is illegal. What is
therefore needed is not an abdication of our collective
responsibility to prevent those grave crimes but a
willingness to apply consistent and uniform standards
of moral outrage to all of them

====================

The will of the international community,
particularly the permanent members of the Security
Council, is obviously crucial. That is especially
important to addressing issues of the admissibility of
actions and to ensure their consistency, since we have
seen that in the face of divisions within the Council,
unilateral actions have led to situations characterized
as illegal but legitimate. We should neither attempt to
establish nor accept any artificial duality between the
twin imperatives of legitimacy and legality. We should
also be mindful that the notion of the responsibility to
protect cannot give way to a mere re-enactment of the
discredited humanitarian interventions of the past. For
we know only too well that such eventualities would be
reserved only for the most powerful States and might
actually lead to preventing justice itself from being
administered

====================

At its core, the responsibility to protect is not a
license to intervene in external situations but rather a
universal principle of non-indifference, in keeping with
the historical context and cultural norms of individual
settings. It is predicated on the express recognition that
the responsibility for the protection of civilians lies,
first and foremost, with Member States. Set against
the overarching principle of State sovereignty, the
responsibility to protect cannot become a basis on
which to contravene the principles of non-interference
and non-intervention, or to question the national
sovereignty or territorial integrity of States

====================

In a world beset by growing socioeconomic
inequalities, situations leading to the responsibility
to protect are more often than not the result of
underdevelopment and poverty. A renewed commitment
to helping States build their capacity, including through
governance and judicial reforms, is therefore crucial. A
long-term commitment on the part of the international
community, including to mobilizing adequate resources
for sustainable development and poverty eradication,
as also reflected in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, is the best investment in prevention

====================

As rightly noted by the Secretary-General in his
latest report (A/72/884), it costs far more to pick up the
pieces after a crisis than it does to prevent it. What is
therefore needed is a surge in diplomacy, not in conflict,
in order to achieve the goal of preventing grave crimes
against humanity.
