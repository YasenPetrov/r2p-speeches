General Assembly Debate Statement: Chile
Unofficial Transcription from webcast
Thank you, Moderator

====================

I’d like to thank the Secretary General for his important report and also recognize the work that has been done
by the special advisors Dang and Lack for the work that they have done to bring forward this debate on the
concept of the Responsibility to Protect. And also, congratulate you Moderator on your new functions and
show you the support of my country. Finally, I’d like to recognize the contributions made by the panelists in
this debate

====================

The report of the Secretary General proposes a clear guide to member states to use all existing tools in the
United Nations in order to deal with a crisis where in a given state crimes are being committed that fall under
the Responsibility to Protect heading. As was quite rightly pointed out in the Secretary General’s report these
three pillars: the responsibility of the state to protect its population, the responsibility of the international
community to cooperate when necessary in order to deal with the problem, or finally, the possibility for the
international community be able to react firmly in order to put an end to these crimes. These three pillars are all
interrelated, as the Secretary General said and the implementation of them is not consecutive overtime

====================

Depending on the situation one pillar might be more relevant from the other, provided that the charter is
respected and Chile fully supports this approach

====================

The appropriate response of the international community is essential, weather it is according to Article 6, 7, 8,
or 9 of the Charter. This is not an academic discussion here Moderator, the response should not necessary be
the use of force, as Secretary General said, there is a broad range of peaceful instruments for intervention to
ensure that the situation changes course

====================

However, prevention is an essential part of R2P and it’s clear that the more the international community invests
in democratic institutions and prevention to ensure that human rights are protected; the less risks there will be
that these four crimes are going to be committed. However, unfortunately these crimes continue to be
committed and when it hasn’t been possible to avoid them then we have to put a stop to them. And as the report
of the institute points out the most appropriate pillar should be used for the given situation

====================

In this respect, I would like to highlight what was said by the Secretary General when he referred to lessons
learned in 2005 with regard to the role that regional organizations should play with regard to early warning and
the implementation of prevention measures, as well as the role that civil society and NGO’s can play. They
usually are the first ones to pick up on signals of risks that these four crimes are about to be committed

====================

Mr. Moderator when circumstances leave no other alternative than Chapter 7 sanctions to be applied and
therefore should be supported by the Security Council. This main body should be able to reach agreement and
be able to approve appropriate measures, and it’s implementable to see the inability to make a decisions when
these crimes are being committed

====================

And also, once a state has decided to apply Chapter 7, mandate should be clear and specific, and there should be
regular reports to the members of the Security Council with regard to the conduct of such operations. This will
lead to greater transparency and legitimacy before the members of the General Assembly of the United Nations

====================

Thank you
