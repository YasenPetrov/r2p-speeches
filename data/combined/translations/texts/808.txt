(spoke in Arabic): I
would like to thank the President for convening this
meeting. Let me also express my deep appreciation to
the Secretary-General for his report (A/73/898), which
contains important conclusions and recommendations,
as well as an evaluation of the efforts of the international
community to put an end to atrocities and to ensure the
obligation of Member States towards accountability
and the rule of law

====================

I also commend the important role of the Group of
Friends on the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), which
we have the honour to co-chair with Denmark. We
associate ourselves with the statement delivered today
on behalf of the Group (see A/73/PV.93)

====================

This third formal General Assembly meeting on
R2P and the inclusion of R2P on its agenda reflect the
progress in the international community’s endorsement
of that principle and its determination to prevent
the crimes of genocide, war crimes, crimes against
humanity and ethnic cleansing. We commend the role
of the General Assembly in developing the principle of
R2P in accordance with the resolutions that have been
adopted to ensure accountability for the perpetrators

of atrocities, as reflected in the creation of the
International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism
to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of
Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes
under International Law Committed in the Syrian Arab
Republic since March 2011, as well as the Independent
Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar

====================

We believe that the commitment to implementing
paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit
Outcome document is critically important to preventing
atrocities by relying on the three pillars of this
principle, with the aim of assisting States in shouldering
their responsibility to protect their population, the
responsibility of the international community to provide
assistance and the options available to respond to the
needs of protection in a timely and decisive manner. It
is therefore necessary for prevention to take the lead in
multilateral international efforts to prevent atrocities

====================

Despite the progress made in operationalizing the
principle of R2P, there is still an increasing need to
bolster the commitment to protecting the vulnerable
and to translating early warning into decisive action, as
part of the principle of prevention. It is also necessary
for national and international efforts to come together
in order to address the causes that contribute to those
atrocities, through respect for human rights, the rule of
law, social justice and the prevention of hate speech,
fighting extremism and achieving development. In that
respect, I note the important role of the United Nations
Agenda for Sustainable Development

====================

The successes achieved in operationalizing
the principle of R2P require ending all kinds of
discrimination based on gender, as well as involving
women and organizations of the international
community in the early-warning process, while using
peacebuilding to create more coherent and inclusive
societies. We take this opportunity to express our
appreciation for all efforts undertaken by the Global
Centre for the Responsibility to Protect

====================

In keeping with the State of Qatar’s commitment
to international cooperation for achieving collective
security and with our policies and ongoing efforts to
curb grave violations of international humanitarian
and human rights law, we have continued to work as
an effective member of the Group of Friends of R2P in
order to bolster this noble principle

====================

The focal point appointed by the Government
of the State of Qatar for R2P has continued to

effectively coordinate with its counterparts in the
States members of the Group. In that connection, in
April 2017 Doha hosted the seventh annual meeting of
the Global Network of R2P Focal Points. In January
2017, Doha also hosted a meeting to take up the issue
of accountability as a means to prevent atrocities,
as well as the role of R2P in combating violent
extremism, in cooperation with the Global Centre for
the Responsibility to Protect, the participation of the
States members of the Gulf Cooperation Council and
the joint Office of the United Nations Special Advisers
on the Prevention of Genocide and on R2P, as well as
the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and a
number of governmental organizations. In that context,
the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies at the
Doha Institute for Graduate Studies has undertaken an
important role in bolstering the principle of R2P and
respecting humanitarian law and human rights

====================

In conclusion, this formal meeting of the General
Assembly sends a very clear message that the
international community is determined to protect
civilians, confront atrocities decisively, end impunity
and hold those responsible for such crimes accountable

====================

The State of Qatar will continue to cooperate with
the international community to ensure respect
for international law and human rights as well as
maintenance of international peace and security.
