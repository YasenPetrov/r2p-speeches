Mr. Moderator,

We studied carefully the latest Teport on “the responsibility to protect”
submitted by the Secretariat

====================

The contents of the Teport once again clearly demonstrate the controversy
around the concept. It does not contain a well-defined understanding of what
"responsibility to protect" means, nor it refers to any examples of successful
implementation thereof

====================

As in the case of previous reports, the report uses vague terms such as
"atrocity crimes" instead of 4 separate crimes mentioned in the Outcome document
of 2005. Since the entire report is built around non-existent definitions it can
provoke erroneous wide interpretations of the concept. The report touches upon
mechanisms that are not mandated to deal with issues of the “responsibility to
Protect” (in particular, the Universal Periodic Review of UNHRC) and goes into
areas not covered by the Outcome document, such as issues of accountability

====================

This is not only a question of methodology. In recent country specific cases,
the implementation of the concept has resulted in complete failure. We however
cannot find in the report any honest analysis of these errors, In this regard the
report unfortunately does not fully reflect the discussions that took place this year

during the informal panels organized in New York and Geneva, As the result the document makes the concept even less clear than before

====================

On the other hand it proposes further institutionalization and formalization of the
concept. We find no logic in this approach

====================

We consider the proposal in paragraph 46 of the report on the inclusion of
the issue as an official agenda item of the General Assembly to be premature and
inappropriate given mentioned circumstances. We would like to recall that back in
2009 the format of the informal interactive dialogue was chosen specifically due to
the controversial character of the concept and different opinions regarding its
content. This gap has only widened. The current format has not fulfilled its
mandate yet

====================

We need to shape the interactive dialogue and panels in a way that would
lead to the genuine reflection of the Member States concerns in the SG’s reports

====================

There is plenty room for this within this format

====================

Accordingly — we would like to make it clear - like a number of other
delegations we would not be able to support — either in the General Committee or
the GA - the initiatives to change this format
