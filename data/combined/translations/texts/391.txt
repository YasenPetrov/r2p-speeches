PERMANENT MISSION OF MEXICO

Statement by Amb. Jorge Montaño, Permanent Representative of Mexico, in the
Informal Interactive Debate on the Responsibility to Protect

New York, September 8, 2014
Mr. president,
We celebrate the completion of this interactive discussion on the responsibility to protect and
We appreciate the report of the Secretary-General on collective responsibility

international assistance

====================

could not start without pointing out that cases like Syria, Iraq, Central African Republic,
and South Sudan, among others, are full proof that those States have failed in their
primary responsibility to protect its population, but also as a community
international, that as an organization, we are failing in our responsibility

collective to prevent heinous crimes committed there

====================

Means for conflict prevention and peacekeeping with which we
They are not being efficiently used. The military response that has been given to such
situations also shows clearly the shortcomings that persist in our model
collective security and is recorded in loss of life and critical delay

the development of the communities affected by the violence

====================

We fully agree that we should encourage international assistance through
use of existing mechanisms in international human rights and
International human right. Commitment to the responsibility to protect is
fully compatible with the narrative of protection of the individual and the State
Straight. As such, we believe that we must strengthen consistency in their treatment

both the organization and the mechanisms of States Parties to these instruments. Mr. president,

We must warn about the irrelevancy in which the United Nations may fall

====================

Paralysis regret that the Council has known against the Syrian case. The nations
United have been forced to attend as silent witnesses to bloody massacres and the use of
weapons of mass destruction which constitute war crimes in the XXI century. This
infamante situation leads us to our organization established to promote

limits on the use of the veto against cases of genocide or crimes against humanity

====================

We must redouble our efforts to share lessons learned, success stories and best
practices responsibility to protect and extend this dialogue at all
levels. In my country, for example, they have begun to address the annual sessions
prevention of heinous crimes in the framework of the Latin American Network for the Prevention
of Genocide and Mass Atrocities. We also participate actively in the Summit

on the Prevention of Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict, held in London

====================

Mr. president,

At nine recommendations of the report of the Secretary-General would add two more:
tenth regards to establishing a responsible arms trade in the world, through
the implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty. We need to close the door to the
irresponsible trade in arms and weapons that cause so much pain and destruction in
some countries, while in others it is a profitable business. And a tenth first to be
refers to carry out all the necessary adjustments to avoid the paralysis of our
Organization in cases of genocide or crimes against humanity. Options

operation of the responsibility to protect are on the table

====================

Mexico makes a call to us to do a reality and that the tenth anniversary of
Summit 2005 is the occasion to celebrate the evolution of responsibility
protect its three pillars. We are still far from making it a complete reality, but
we can say that today we have better tools to exercise so
balanced, transparent, accountable and attached to the rule of law
