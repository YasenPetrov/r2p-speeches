At the outset, I am confident that the discussion of the
agenda item on the responsibility to protect (R2P) and
the prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity will be held in accordance
with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the
United Nations and bring about good results under the
President’s leadership

====================

The delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea would like to take this opportunity to clarify
its position with regard to the agenda item as follows

====================

First, the issue of protecting people from genocide,
war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity falls entirely under the sovereignty of the
States concerned. R2P is a product of humanitarian
intervention, which has been rejected by the international
community in the past. State sovereignty is sacred and
inviolable. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of States and non-interference in their internal
affairs are cornerstones of international relations. R2P
violations of our principles are is nothing more than an
excuse to justify interference in the internal affairs of
the small and big countries

====================

Secondly, genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity can be attributed not to
States that do not have adequate ability to protect their
people, but rather to the flagrant infringement of State
sovereignty. The interference of Western countries in
States’ internal affairs creates upheavals such as arms
conflicts, terrorism, genocide and mass destruction,
which are long-standing in Middle Eastern and African
countries, including Syria, Iraq, Libya and so on. As
reality shows, it is a self-evident truth that developing
countries will fall victim to R2P

====================

If the United Nations, which is mandated to
establish a fair international order based on sovereign

equality, turns a blind eye to that reality and continues
to tolerate the false claims of Western countries, that
will obviously trigger more miserable outcomes. The
United Nations should no longer tolerate the sinister
schemes of Western countries that are pursuing
political, economic and military interventions in other
countries under the pretext of R2P

====================

In conclusion, the delegation of the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea hereby stresses that, in
international relations, the principle of the respect for
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and
non-interference in their internal affairs should be
strictly upheld and the issue of R2P should be dealt with
in keeping with the common demands and interests of
all Member States.
