Mr. Secretary General,
Mr. and Mrs. Special Advisers,

I would first like to thank the President of the General Assembly for the organization
this debate. I also thank the Secretary General for his excellent report, which sets six
priorities for the implementation of the responsibility to protect in the next decade

====================

Belgium fully supports the EU statement, as well as the Joint Declaration of
group of friends of the responsibility to protect. I would however briefly
speak in a national capacity on some points

====================

First, this year marks the tenth anniversary of the 2005 World Summit,
consecrated the principle of responsibility to protect. It seems appropriate and useful
the General Assembly take this opportunity to adopt a commemorative resolution and
reaffirming its commitment to the responsibility to protect. Similarly, we
now seems necessary to insert a "responsibility to protect" point in the order of
day of the General Assembly

====================

Second, there are many own shares to facilitate the implementation of the
responsibility to protect. All are important, but I would like to mention two of
they:

- The right of veto in the Security Council:
The photographs of the body of the little Aylan lying on a Mediterranean beach, have
Iced everyone. They have a name, a face - that of a little boy of three
years - a tragedy. This tragedy is rooted in a conflict in which the country
concerned, primary responsibility, the Security Council but also the entire
international community could not stop, despite their responsibility
protect

====================

The Security Council does not appear able to fulfill its responsibility to protect
as it will be to thank you for the use of the veto by the permanent members

====================

Therefore, more than ever, Belgium supports the French initiative on the frame
veto it. We also support the Code of Conduct on the actions of the
Security Council against genocide, war crimes and crimes
against humanity, developed in the ACT Group. We invite all States
members to express their support for both initiatives

====================

- The fight against impunity:
The fight against impunity is not a catchphrase that is absolutely fit into his

interventions at different debate held in this House. It means
concretely as if the author of war crimes - which affects men,
women and children, those of which we have perhaps not seen the photos, but
the stories are unfortunately also chilling than the small Aylan - not only is not considered for the atrocities he committed, but also is received with
honor of the world, he will feel encouraged to commit further atrocities

====================

Belgium supports the International Criminal Court in its unprecedented effort
for the continuation of auteurs.de heinous crimes, wherever they are. As
WEOG non-cooperation focal point for the Bureau of the Assembly of States Parties, the
Belgium calls on behalf of victims of different situations addressed by the Court,
each member state - they either party or not to the Rome Statute - to cooperate with
this one

====================

Third, allow me, Mr. President, to highlight some
activities undertaken by Belgium to face current challenges
Responsibility to Protect:

- First action: In order to provide a practical tool for States their
allowing both to comply with their international obligations and to make
their effective national judicial systems in the field, Argentina, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Slovenia propose to set up a modern multilateral treaty
procedure on mutual legal assistance and extradition in order to facilitate the practice
Cooperation among States that conduct investigations and prosecution
crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes

====================

- Second action: Belgium has concluded with the International Criminal Court six agreements
for the protection of witnesses and enforcement of sentences. Note also that we
have established a National Central Authority for cooperation with courts
international, who can offer an immediate response to the requests of these
jurisdictions. It is through this central authority that Belgium could stop Jean-
Pierre Bemba while traveling in Belgium and she was transferred to the Criminal Court
international

====================

- Third activity: Belgium is also facing the problem of

radicalization. Among the foreign fighters flocking to Syria and
contribute to the tragedies that local populations face are
also Belgians. In 2013, the Belgian authorities have adopted a plan for the
preventing radicalization. For several other projects have been completed, including a
program to the ten most affected cities, and an action plan against
radicalization in prison, including specialized monitoring program for inmates nearing
radicalization. Other levels of government in Belgium have also launched initiatives
which all focus on the training of actors on the ground, including the
teachers and social workers

====================

I take this opportunity to point out that the Special Adviser on the Prevention
genocide and Belgium are organizing the 1st October at 1:01 p.m. Ministerial side event
entitled '' A comprehensive approach to Preventing radicalization and violent extremism
and atrocity crimes activating voices from actors in the field, In Particular women ". ||
chaired by the Foreign Minister of Belgium, Didier Reynders Gents and
by the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Mr. Adama Dieng.
