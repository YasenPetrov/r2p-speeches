Je vous remercie de votte attention. Unofficial translation
Mtr. Moderator,

I would like to salute the initiative of the General Assembly to organise this fourth informal
interactive dialogue of the UN General Assembly, which gives us the opportunity to discuss the
responsibility to protect at a moment where current events show how relevant this principle,
which was adopted in 2005, remains. Allow me also to join previous speakers in thanking the
Secretary-General for his very comprehensive report and the intervention he made this morning,
as well as in welcoming you, Mr. Dieng, as the new Special Adviser on the Prevention of
Genocide

====================

Luxembourg fully associates itself with the statement by the European Union. I would like to
underline three elements in a national capacity

====================

1. The unprecedented crisis prevailing in Syria since March 2011 shows how difficult it can be
for the international community to respond in a timely and decisive manner when “national
authorities are manifestly failing to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and ctimes against humanity”. As its death toll unfortunately grows heavier day by day,
this crisis cannot be ignored. But it should not make us forget either that, last year, the Security
Council has been able to compellingly remind States of their responsibility to protect their
populations, notably in the case of Libya, Céte d'Ivoire and Yemen

====================

2. In order to make further progress, it is healthy to hold an honest debate at the United Nations,
as we ate doing today, and take into account the criticisms levelled at the manner in which the
responsibility to protect has been “operationalised”. The initiative on “responsibility while
protecting”, launched by Brazil in September 2011, is the most visible manifestation of the
concetn which I believe we all shate, and which is a common sense concern: the application of
the principle of the responsibility to protect must not contribute to endangering even further the
populations that one seeks to protect. The important lesson to be learned in our view is that we
must act in a timely and decisive manner, since the longer we wait, the more dramatic and costly
to all concerned the eventual intervention will be. Prevention is always preferable. But in ordet to
be effective, prevention requires an early-warning system which draws upon the expertise and
information available to all involved patties: the United Nations System, regional and sub-
regional organisations, Member States of course, civil society and even individuals, in a day and
age where information is transmitted instantaneously and mobilisation takes place through social
networks. Prevention also requites the appropriate use of deterring measures, like the
implementation of international commissions of inquity ot fact-finding missions or the threat of
referrals to the International Criminal Court

====================

3. Finally, I would like draw from my experience as Chairperson of the Guinea Configuration of
the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC. I believe that, even if the PBC is not named as such in the
Secretary-General’s report, it can usefully contribute to the implementation of the principle of
the responsibility to protect, by reducing the tisk of a return to violence in a post-conflict setting

====================

The Guinea Configuration attentively follows the progress made in the implementation of the

3 fecommendations of the international commission of inquiry which was mandated to investigate
the events of 28 September 2009 in the stadium of Conakry

====================

Mr. Moderator,

Since the 2005 World Summit, Luxembourg has supported the development and implementation
of the principle of the responsibility to protect in order to prevent the recurrence of crimes
against humanity like those committed in the past century, notably on the European continent

====================

We owe it to the memory of the millions of victims of the crimes of the past to perfect this
principle, together, as United Nations
