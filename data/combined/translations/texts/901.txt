I have the honour
to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and
its member States. The former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania, as well as
Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Georgia, align
themselves with this statement

====================

The European Union welcomes the inclusion of
today’s debate on the responsibility to protect on the
formal agenda of the General Assembly at its seventysecond session. It is very apposite to be discussing our
responsibility at a moment when there are allegations
of mass atrocities being committed in various corners
of the globe

====================

The European Union, like the United Nations, was
born after the horrors of the Second World War, in a
spirit of “never again”. The responsibility to protect is
at the core of our primary goal, which is to enable our
populations to live in peace and security. When we fail
in our responsibility to protect, we fail our very reason
for being here

====================

It is a well-established principle that prevention is
far more effective than reaction, and that is where the
European Union concentrates the implementation of its
responsibility to protect. Our efforts, and those of the
international community, must now focus on making
prevention more effective. In that context, we support
the Secretary-General’s broad focus on prevention,
which fully resonates with the European approach to
security, as envisaged in the Global Strategy for the
European Union’s Foreign and Security Policy. In the
wider agenda of preventing conflict and sustaining
peace, atrocity prevention must become central. The
ongoing reform of the United Nations should enhance
synergies, capacities and accountability across the
system to make it fit to address the multisectoral
challenges of preventing atrocities

====================

In that context, the European Union welcomes the
focus of this year’s report of the Secretary-General
(A/72/884), entitled “Responsibility to protect: from
early warning to early action”. Improving our earlywarning capacity and, based on our assessments,
moving quickly to early action is the key to the
effective prevention of crimes against humanity, war
crimes, genocide and ethnic cleansing. The European
Union and its member States will take all the relevant
recommendations of the report under consideration to
inform our policies and actions

====================

The European Union particularly welcomes the
threefold strategy for strengthening early action
proposed by the Secretary-General in his report. We will
continue strengthening our capacity to prevent atrocities
and supporting partner countries in strengthening their
own. Through a multidimensional approach, using all
available policies and instruments, the responsibility
to protect has been made an integral part of the
Global Strategy for the European Union’s Foreign and
Security Policy. Our conflict early-warning system
includes the risk of mass atrocities taken into account
in European Union policy considerations. Atrocity
prevention has been integrated into our field missions
and operations working for the protection of civilians,
as well as into capacity-building programmes guided

by the new European Consensus on Development

====================

We are preparing a dedicated, evidence-based toolkit
on atrocity prevention to provide the staff of our
diplomatic, military and civilian missions with handson knowledge of how they can assess the risks of
atrocity prevention and what they can do to support it

====================

In our experience, as stressed in the SecretaryGeneral’s report, regional organizations can have
an added value in atrocity prevention, thanks to
their specific early-warning mechanisms, conflict
prevention and resolution capacities and potential for
channelling assessments, good practices and lessons
learned. The European Union encourages relevant
regional organizations to embed the principles of the
responsibility to protect in their practice and priorities,
and to take appropriate action to help prevent atrocity
crimes. Appointing a focal point on the responsibility
to protect, as the European Union has done, would be
a useful and necessary step for regional organizations
to raise awareness about the principle internally and
among their membership, with a view to consolidating
and enhancing atrocity-prevention activities. The
European Union stands ready to share its experience
with other regional actors

====================

Guidance, coordination and support from the
United Nations to its Member States are crucial in
preventing atrocities. The EU will continue to support
the Secretary-General’s Special Advisers on the
Prevention of Genocide and on the Responsibility to
Protect in their efforts to mainstream the prevention of
atrocities across the United Nations

====================

We would like to thank Mr. Ivan Šimonović
, former Special Adviser on the Responsibility to
Protect, for his work in that area. Now that his mandate
has ended, we welcome the Secretary-General’s
intention to quickly appoint a new Special Adviser. In
our view, the next Special Adviser should preferably
have relevant experience in making atrocity prevention
operational. Once someone is appointed, we encourage
the Secretary-General to ensure that he or she has
access to all the information and decision-making
processes necessary to inform and support assessments
and actions regarding the responsibility to protect

====================

As the Secretary-General stresses in his threefold
strategy, we must continue promoting accountability for
atrocity prevention. The European Union and its member
States remain committed to efforts to end impunity for
mass atrocities at the national and international levels

====================

States have the primary responsibility to investigate and
prosecute crimes committed within their jurisdictions,
while international courts and hybrid tribunals can
play an important role where States are unwilling or
unable to do so genuinely. We actively promote the
universality of the Rome Statute and foster capacities
for accountability and reconciliation, which are key
elements for non-recurrence, through our support for
the International Criminal Court

====================

of mass atrocities effective, thereby responding to our
responsibility to protect

====================

Within the United Nations system, the Security
Council should use all available tools in the exercise
of its responsibility to protect populations from
mass atrocities. The General Assembly, the Human
Rights Council and human rights treaty bodies and
mechanisms, as well as the Security Council, must
also be mobilized in preventing those atrocities. The
Secretary-General’s Human Rights Up Front initiative
works as an enabler of enhancing system-wide capacity
in the United Nations to prevent mass violations of
human rights and international humanitarian law

====================

The Forum members would like to thank the
Secretary-General and the President of the General
Assembly for their statements. We also commend the
Secretary-General for his report (A/72/884) and its
focus on the importance of early warning and early
action in response to the risk of mass atrocities

====================

The EU wholeheartedly endorses the third
dimension of the Secretary-General’s proposed strategy
for early action through expanding civilian action for
atrocity prevention. We have been encouraging dialogue
among a wide spectrum of national and international
civil society actors, and we have been supporting their
efforts in conflict and atrocity prevention, mediation
and peacebuilding. We support the role that women
and youth can play in de-escalating tensions and
building peace in their communities. We acknowledge
the importance of engaging religious leaders and
faith-based actors in the fight against discrimination
of minorities, hate speech and other risk factors for
mass atrocities

====================

The EU expects a rich and fruitful debate today. We
encourage States to voice their support for the principle
of the responsibility to protect and, outside this Hall,
to devise and exchange views on ways to strengthen
preventive capacities. In view of the challenges that the
world is facing today, we would welcome the inclusion
of the responsibility to protect as a formal item on the
agenda of the General Assembly at its coming sessions

====================

From the outset, the EU has been a staunch
supporter of the principle of the responsibility to protect

====================

In partnership with other States and with regional and
international organizations, in particular the United
Nations, we will continue working to make prevention
