Statement delivered by the Deputy Permanent Representative and Charge’ d’Affaires
a.i. of Italy to the United Nations, Ambassador Inigo Lambertini, at the General
Assembly Informal Interactive Dialogue on the Report of the Secretary General on the
Responsibility to Protect --Mr. President,
First, I would like to thank you for convening this important debate, a major opportunity
to reaffirm the global commitment to the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). I would also
like to thank the Secretary-General for the advocacy he continues to provide through
his annual reports, the Special Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide and the
Responsibility to Protect for their crucial work in promoting the concept of R2P and Mr
Feltman and Mr. Steiner for their presentations

====================

Italy aligns itself with the statements delivered by the European Union and the Group
of Friends and would like to make some brief remarks in a national capacity

====================

There is no longer any doubt that the protection of populations from genocide, ethnic
cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity is at the same time a national and
international responsibility. Yet, atrocity crimes continue to take a devastating toll on
humanity, while the international community spends far more time and resources
responding to crises than on preventing them, as the Secretary-General emphasized in
his latest report and in his remarks to the Security Council earlier this year

====================

Furthermore, the growing numbers of attacks against civilians, schools, hospitals,
humanitarian workers and peacekeepers – as well as the widespread and systematic use
of sexual and gender-based violence as a deliberate strategy by state and non-state
actors – are a stark reminder that we need to close the gap between our commitment
to the R2P and the reality populations at risk face. Our efforts should honor the norms

and principles that safeguard humanity under international humanitarian law, human
rights and refugee law

====================

This is why Italy fully supports the Secretary-General’s call for a new approach to close
this gap, through prioritizing meaningful preventive efforts and strengthening
accountability for the implementation of the R2P

====================

As the top Western Troop-Contributing Country for peacekeeping operations, Italy has
acknowledged the importance of the Kigali Principles on the Protection of Civilians
since the moment they were launched, and wishes to highlight the importance of early
warning mechanisms, such as the UN Framework for Analysis for Atrocity Crimes, which
should be integrated into pre-deployment and in-theatre training for all peacekeepers

====================

Italy, moreover, has appointed a National R2P Focal Point and participates in the Global
Network of R2P Focal Points, together with fifty-eight other Member States from every
region of the world, as along with the European Union. As it attaches great importance
to improving national and collective accountability for prevention, Italy wishes to echo
the Secretary-General’s encouragement to all Member States to follow suit

====================

When it comes to the need for improved accountability for atrocity prevention, efforts
to mainstream R2P across the whole UN system must be further strengthened so that
all the internal tools and capacities available can serve this purpose and effectively
protect vulnerable populations. In this regard, I would like to reiterate my Country’s
support for such initiatives as Human Rights Up Front, which aims to improve the
system-wide capacity of the UN to prevent and respond to serious violations of
international human rights and humanitarian law. We therefore call on the Secretary
General to put R2P and the prevention of mass atrocities at the heart of his prevention
agenda

====================

As a member of the Security Council in 2017, Italy has also made its best efforts to
cooperate with other Member States and ensure that the Security Council acts
effectively and consistently when faced with situations of emerging risk, upholding our
responsibility to protect the world’s most vulnerable civilians. Indeed, the unity of the
Security Council is the crucial factor to achieve the core objective of this Council: the
protection of civilians

====================

Thank you

====================
