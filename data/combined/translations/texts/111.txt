Mr. president,

Costa Rica adheres to the statement made by the Netherlands in
behalf of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect

====================

I take this opportunity to renew our
I commitment to this principle recognized in paragraphs 138 and 139
from the Outcome Document of the World Summit. We agree with Mr.
Secretary General, that we have a legal commitment, moral and
policy to achieve full implementation

====================

We appreciate the report of the Secretary-General and ideas raised
in the panel discussion, precisely they reaffirm the relevance and
validity of the principle and present us with the challenges of a reality
International much more complex. Costa Rica

Today, state and non-state actors threaten populations
civilians and show absolute disrespect for human life and dignity

====================

Millions of people escape daily violence and
vejámenes those who are subjected, thousands are killed
with impunity

====================

We know that the principle of Responsibility to Protect is related
with a significant number of obligations under international law,
derived from both the international human rights law
as the International Humanitarian Law, not to commit
systematic violations of human rights and protect
civilians, both individually and collectively thereof. No
However, the international community has chosen, in many cases,
by carrying out timid actions or inaction

====================

Every day the casualties in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Libya or
Central African Republic and elsewhere. During the last
months, we have seen with astonishment the persecution suffered by the people
Rohingya in Myanmar, which only in the last two weeks has
left a toll of about 120 thousand displaced, hundreds of
people dead and more than 400 thousand people of the Muslim minority
trapped in conflict areas in the west of that country. And while
both here in New York, as a result of political divisions
and geopolitical interests, the principal organs of the United Nations
United, do not take effective actions and measures not so
efficient measures to prevent and stop attacks against
civil population. Costa Rica

That's why, we do today called vehemently members
of the Security Council, whether permanent or elected, to honor
the United Nations Charter and fulfill its mandate to ensure
prompt and effective action in its primary responsibility for maintaining
international peace and security and the permanent members
refrain from using the veto in cases of genocide, crimes
and atrocious crimes against humanity

====================

Collective international action to prevent mass atrocities,
It must be based on impartial information that is collected from
way outside political pressures. For this reason, Costa Rica
supports initiatives such as the Independent and Impartial Mechanism
Syria and Human Rights Initiative Up front. We call on the
membership to support the ACT Code of Conduct against
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity

====================

In addition, we invite you to accept the recommendations of the Secretary
Overall, strengthening internal mechanisms for early warning and
prevention of atrocities, taking into account all prevention
spheres of public affairs, incorporate into our systems
internal legal international human rights standards and
international humanitarian law, ensure accountability
of the security forces, whether military or civilian

====================

To achieve the non-recurrence of atrocities, it is imperative to deal with
national reconciliation processes post-conflict justice through
transitional, preserving memory and peacebuilding
social, for which it is necessary to end impunity and bring to Costa Rica
