Mr. Chairman,

Costa Rica adheres to the declaracién made by Netherlands in
behalf of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect

====================

I take this opportunity to renew our
I commitment to this principle recognized in paragraphs 138 and 139
from the Outcome Document of the World Summit. We agree with the Sefior
Secretary General, that we have a legal commitment, moral and
politician to achieve full implementation

We appreciate the report of the Secretary-General and ideas raised

validity of the principle and present us with challenges of a reality
International much more complex. Costa Rica

Today, state and non-state actors threaten populations
civilians and show absolute disrespect for human life and dignity

====================

Millions of people escape daily violence and
vej4menes those who are subjected, thousands are killed
with impunity

====================

We know that the principle of Responsibility to Protect is related
with a significant number of obligations under international law,
derived from both the international human rights law
as the International Humanitarian Law, not to commit
systematic violations of human rights and protect
civilians, both individually and collectively thereof. No
However, the international community has chosen, in many cases,
by carrying out timid or actions by the inaccién

====================

Day by day the casualties in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Libya or
Central African Republic and elsewhere. During the last
months, we have watched in awe the people suffering persecucién
Rohingya in Myanmar, which only in the last two weeks has
left a toll of about 120 thousand displaced, hundreds of
people dead and more than 400 thousand people from the Muslim minority
trapped in conflict areas in the west of the country. And while
both here in New York, as a result of political divisions
and geopolitical interests, the main Erganos of Nations
United, do not take effective actions and measures not so
efficient measures to prevent and stop attacks against
civil population. Costa Rica

That's why, we do today called vehemently members
of the Security Council, whether permanent or elected, to honor
the United Nations Charter and fulfill its mandate to ensure
prompt and effective action in its primary responsibility for maintaining
international peace and security and the permanent members
refrain from using the veto in situations of genocide, crimes
and atrocious crimes against humanity

====================

The Acci6n international collective to prevent mass atrocities,
It must be based on fair informacién to be collected from
way outside political pressures. For this reason, Costa Rica
supports initiatives such as the Independent and Impartial Mechanism
Syria and Human Rights Initiative Up front. We call on the
cédigo membership to support the conduct of ACT against
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity

====================

In addition, we invite you to accept the recommendations of the Secretary
Overall, strengthening internal mechanisms for early warning and
prevention of atrocities, taking into account all prevencidén
spheres of public affairs, incorporate into our systems
internal legal international human rights standards and

of the security forces, whether military or civilian

====================

To achieve the non-recurrence of atrocities, it is imperative to deal with
conciliacién national processes post conflict through justice
transitional, the preservacién memory and peace reconstruccién
social, for which it is necessary to end impunity and bring to Costa Rica
