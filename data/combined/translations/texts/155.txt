STATEMENT

by

H. E. Mr. Amadu Koroma
Deputy Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone
to the United Nations

at the
8%» Annual Informal, Interactive Dialogue of the General Assembly on the
Responsibility of States to Protect their populations by preventing genocide,

war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity through
appropriate and necessary means

====================

New York, 6% September, 2016

Check Against Delivery Mr. Moderator,

My delegation is very pleased to participate in this year’s Informal Interactive Dialogue on the
responsibility of states to protect their people, convened by the President of the General
Assembly. We sincerely hope that the purposes of this dialogue which are to enable member
states to assess the obstacles to mobilizing collective action; how such obstacles could be
overcome; the next steps to accelerate implementation of the R2P Principle and improved
capacity to coordinate early responses will be achieved

====================

We have asked for the floor not only to respond to the above objectives but to also to reiterate
the commitment which my country made at the 2005 World Summit to its responsibility to
protect its people from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The
basis for our recommitment stems from the fact that we have had the experience of a very bitter
and destructive civil war that lasted for eleven years from 1991 to 2002 in which all kinds of
atrocities were committed against the people. This blemish in our national history will continue
to serve as a constant reminder to us and we will continue to appreciate the need to foster
peaceful coexistence and never again to go down the destructive path of violence

====================

As you may recall, those who bear the most serious responsibility for those atrocities did not go
unpunished, they were tried at the Special Court and those found guilty are now serving their
sentences. The residual mechanisms of the Special Court are now being managed by the
Residual Special Court for Sierra Leone. Funding is a major obstacle for this court and we hope
to engage with member states very soon to share with you the various options that are available
to ensure a more reliable and sustainable funding for the court

====================

Mr. Moderator,

My delegation acknowledges the fact that prevention of violent conflict remains the most critical
ambit of the Principle of R2P. Where there is peace and harmony in a state, there will not only be
development, progress and quality life for the people but also there will be no need for those in
authority to commit crimes that will shock the conscience of mankind such as war crimes, ethnic
cleansing, genocide and crimes against humanity. Ensuring a perpetual and sustainable peace at
the national and global level is therefore essential to the success of R2P

====================

Government in my country sees the need to ensure sustainable peace and harmony by constantly
engaging with all stakeholders including the opposition, traditional rulers, religious, women,
youth groups and civil society. Requisite political space is given to the opposition and free
speech is encouraged by allowing private radio stations and newspapers to operate freely within
the ambit of the law to discourage underground and nefarious political activities. Efforts to
promote the rule of law and maintain the independence and strengthen national institutions such
as the judiciary are well advanced. If the people have confidence in the legal processes, the need
to resort to violence will be averted. But peace alone is not enough; underdevelopment, proper
management and equitable distribution of national resources, extreme poverty, poor education,
and diseases will continue to serve as drivers of conflict. Mr. Moderator,

My delegation welcomes the Secretary General’s report on R2P which was presented this
morning and which contain elements such as conflict prevention strategies, early warning
mechanisms, rapid global response to the outbreak of conflicts, data collection, increasing
capacity in information sharing, complementarity with other mechanisms, coordination with
regional bodies, institutional capacities, regional networks, etc. are agreeable to my delegation

====================

We will continue to support the principle of R2P because the idea of its formation is firmly
rooted in the Charter of the United Nations. We welcome your appointment as Special Adviser
of the Secretary General on Responsibility to Protect and we wish you a very productive tenure

====================

We look forward to a frequent interaction between your office and member states of the United
Nations. Your predecessor Jenifer Welsh did a marvelous job, the leadership that she provided,
her commitment and her contributions will serve as a foundation from which you can take from
to further advance the accomplishments made so far

====================

Mr. Moderator,

My delegation will continue to align itself with the call for full support of the Rome Statute and
the International Criminal Court established to address impunity for gross crimes of human
atrocities. Notwithstanding the challenges, my delegation continues to recognize the ICC as a
platform of accountability for perpetrators of horrendous crimes. We call on those States that
have not yet ratified the Rome Statute to do so because it is only the Statute enjoys universality
that the Court can become more effective and relevant

====================

Mr. Chairman, Sierra Leone wishes to align itself with the proposals relating to the suspension of
the veto in cases involving mass atrocities and genocide

====================

I thank you for your kind attention.
