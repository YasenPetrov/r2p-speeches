Statement delivered by Thailand â€“ Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2017
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]
Mr. President,
It is my honor to represent my delegation at the Informal Interactive Dialogue of the General Assembly on
the Responsibility to Protect today. I wish to also thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report
on this issue, which focuses on the accountability for prevention of the atrocity crimes. This dialogue could
not be more timely. Patience, intolerance, insecurity, and violence are on the rise. Thailand reaffirms its
support on the general concept of the responsibility to protect, that each and every state has the primary
responsibility to protect its own population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against
humanity. The wider international community also has a responsibility to assist individual states in ensuring
that this norm and its true purpose, which aims to safeguard humanity, is upheld. Thailand also attaches
great importance to the protection of civilians in accordance with international humanitarian law. They must
not be put at risk, nor become target of violence

====================

Mr. President,
R2P is still often misinterpreted and misused because of the lack of conversions of a common understanding,
especially on pillar three. As a result, the international community often fail to take the necessary steps to
prevent or stop those horrible crimes. This forum, therefore, provides us a good opportunity to continue our
deliberations. A clear criterion for invoking collective action in a timely and decisive manner when a state
manifestly fails to protect its own populations is necessary. Prevention of atrocity crimes is fundamental to
achieving the sustaining development goals, especially goal 16. In this regard, strengthening accountability
both at national and international level can significantly contribute to the promotion just, peaceful, and
inclusive societies. Last, but not least, Thailand strongly believes that prevention and capacity building are
central to effective implementation of the three-pillar strategy. The Responsibility to Protect and collective
action undertaken under-taken by the international community can be achieved not only through
humanitarian intervention alone in time of conflict. As a starting point, we should work together to prevent
these atrocity crimes by empowering people to become resilient, rendering long-term assistance with an aim
to fostering sustainable development, inclusive growth, and stability, closing down gaps and eliminating
inequality and ensuring respect for fundamental freedom and human rights

====================

I thank you
