Mr. President,

I would like to thank the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his report based on
the theme “Responsibility of States and Prevention

====================

I would also like to congratulate the moderator and the panelists for their contribution
to the unraveling of the present interactive dialogue on the theme indicated above

====================

Mr. President,
[Eight] years after World Summit which enshrined the concept of responsibility to
Protect, my country salutes the efforts deployed by the General Assembly, the Security
Council, and other Member-States of the United Nations to advance said concept

====================

My country feels that the submission of periodic reports and the annual holding of an
informal interactive dialogue on the question, like this one, as well as the recent
nomination of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the responsibility to
Protect, will continue to promote the concept

====================

I would also like to salute the organization of the gathering, this past 11th and 12th of
June in Accra, Ghana, of the global network of National Focal Points on the
Responsibility to Protect. My country participated in this gathering, which allowed to
better understand the importance of having access to a national protection mechanism
and to prevent possible atrocity crimes in the case that these might exist

====================

My country is convinced that even in the absence of judicial obligations, there exists a
moral obligation to provide societies with the means of protecting populations against
criminal atrocities, thereby reinforcing the Sovereignty of the State by augmenting the
chances for peace and stability. This shows that my country fully subscribes to the first
two Pillars of R2P, consisting in a reminder of the sovereignty of States to protect their
populations, without any external interference, and of the international community’s
obligation to assist the State in this respect, per said State’s request

====================

My country understands the Responsibility to Protect primarily as the act of taking all
necessary measures underlying in national laws and international law to prevent any
tension which could potentially be the source of atrocities. We might as well say that
Togo subscribes to the content of the Secretary-General’s fifth report, which advises to
examine the underlying causes to allow for taking measures that should prevent
atrocities in the case that these might exist. That is how, for example, in the case of
elections, which are increasingly a serious threat to national, and sometimes
international, stability all efforts are made to implement visible judicial and institutional

mechanisms for conflict prevention and peace promotion. As for the legislative elections
of 25th July 2013, these mechanisms and institutions have taken the shape of
agreements between the Government, political parties, and the representatives of civil
society, with the participation of several politicians, religious clerics, union
representatives, and a Permanent Framework for Dialogue and Consultation, which
have allowed violence-less elections

====================

Mr. President,
I am also proud that on the regional level, the early warning mechanism implemented
by my country works actively with the regional early warning mechanisms created
within ECOWAS. As a Member-State of ECOWAS, we have had good neighborly
relations between States, a priority, such that any difficulty a Member-State meets
automatically invokes the others. Thus, Togo has taken an active part not only in the
formulation and implementation of the intervention strategies of ECOWAS within the
framework of R2P, but also as a provider of troops for the crises of some countries in the
sub-region like Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau and Mali, with the agreement of
these countries

====================

Togo is proud that these States, which had not done so before, are in the process of
nominating National Focal Points who will allow for better coordination on the topic,
hopefully beyond ECOWAS and on the African level
