UNITED NATIONS
PRESS RELEASE
For immediate release
Statement by Adama Dieng, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide
following OHCHR’s report on the situation in northern Rakhine State, Myanmar
(New York, 6 February 2017) The United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of
Genocide, Adama Dieng, stated that he was shocked and alarmed to read the accounts of serious
human rights violations being committed against Muslim Rohingya in northern Rakhine State by
Myanmar’s security forces, as set out in the report published on 3 February by the United
Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). According to the
findings of the report, human rights violations committed by the security forces include mass
gang-rape, extra judicial killings – including of babies and young children - brutal beatings and
disappearances. These attacks have taken place in the context of an escalation of violence in
northern Rakhine State since border security posts were attacked by armed assailants in early
October 2016

====================

There have been allegations that security forces were committing serious human rights violations
against the civilian population of northern Rakhine State from the very beginning of the recent
escalation of violence. “I and many others have been urging the authorities to conduct an
independent and impartial investigation into these allegations. The investigation conducted by
OHCHR gives further credibility to those accounts and describes a level of dehumanization and
cruelty that is revolting, and unacceptable. This must stop right now!”
The Special Adviser welcomed the Government’s commitment to investigate the matter
immediately. The commission previously appointed by the Government to investigate allegations
of human rights violations in norther Rakhine state, which was led by Vice-President U Myint
Swe, reported just a few weeks ago that it had found no evidence, or insufficient evidence, of any
wrongdoing by Government forces

====================

“I am concerned that the Government Commission, which had unhindered access to the location
of the incidents, found nothing to substantiate the claims, while OHCHR, which was not given
access to the area, found an overwhelming number of testimonies and other forms of evidence
through interviews with refugees who had fled to a neighbouring country” stated the Special
Adviser. “The existing Commission is not a credible option to undertake the new investigation. I
urge that any investigation be conducted by a truly independent and impartial body that includes
international observers. If the Government wants the international community and regional
actors to believe in their willingness to resolve the matter, they must act responsibly and
demonstrate their sincerity.”
According to the Special Adviser, “There is no more time to wait. All of this is happening
against the background of very deeply rooted and long-standing discriminatory practices and
policies against the Rohingya Muslims and a failure to put in place conditions that would support
peaceful coexistence among the different communities in Rakhine State. If people are being
persecuted based on their identity and killed, tortured, raped and forcibly transferred in a
widespread or systematic manner, this could amount to crimes against humanity, and in fact be

the precursor of other egregious international crimes. The Government has a responsibility to
protect its populations against these atrocious and punishable acts.”
