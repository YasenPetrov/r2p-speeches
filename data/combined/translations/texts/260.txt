Statement delivered by the Delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco to the United
Nations, at the United Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion "From
commitment to implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened
by the President of the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
25 February 2016
The 2005 was a key moment for the concept of Responsibility to Protect, it reflected the
commitment of States to respond to crisis situations in order to protect populations from the
clearly defined crimes of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity

====================

The summit defined the scope of application of Responsibility to Protect and limited the case
to where a State is unable or unwilling to protect its population against the most serious crimes

====================

In this regards, Morocco reaffirms its commitment to paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005
WSOD, which affirms that each individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations
from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity

====================

As we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of Responsibility to Protect, this concept has taken
a new dimension in the light of recent developments in the world. If the concept gained wider
support within the international community during the last years, it nonetheless continues to
raise questions on the best way and means of its implementation to avoid an uncontrolled
implementation and any possible instrumentalization or political exploitation of its novel
objectives, this was the work of the Marrakech conference

====================

Morocco would like to, in this regard, reiterate the intersect relationship between the 3 pillars
of the Responsibility to Protect which are the responsibilities of the State to protect,
international assistance and capacity building and timely and decisive response. Aware of the
importance of prevention in the implementation of the Responsibility to Protect, the Kingdom
of Morocco would like to stress that State sovereignty implies its primary responsibility to
protect its own populations

====================

In this respect, it is crucial the support to States in order to allow them to reinforce their national
mechanisms, legal protection of the populations through strengthened legal instruments and
the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law. Capacity building and technical assistance
are, indeed, the best preventative measures which enable States to create an enabling
environment to protect their respective populations, this was one of the most important
recommendations of the Marrakech conference

====================

Morocco recalls the establishment, during the 2005 World Summit, of a consensual
formulation of the concept of Responsibility to Protect which makes it clear that this
responsibility must be exercised, first of all, by non-coercive measures such as the use of
diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means and that it is only in cases where all these
attempts are insufficient that coercive measures should be considered as a last resort while
strictly complying with the UN Charter and respecting the strict and non-selective rules of
international humanitarian law

====================

In conclusion, the Kingdom of Morocco underlines that the full implementation of the
Responsibility to Protect can only be achieved through the consolidation of democracy, the
rule of law as well as the respect for human rights and individual and collective freedoms
