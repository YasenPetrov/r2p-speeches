I take the floor to provide
an explanation of vote with respect to draft resolution
A/73/L.94, entitled “Towards torture-free trade:
examining the feasibility, scope and parameters for
possible common international standards”

====================

Jamaica will vote against the draft resolution for
the following reasons

====================

First, we are concerned about the text’s attempts to
conflate issues related to human rights and trade without
the full ventilation of possible implications in the Third
Committee or the World Trade Organization (WTO). It
is noted that the fifth preambular paragraph highlights
the absence of common international standards on
the import, export and transfer of goods for the uses
listed. We maintain that such discussions related to the
formulation of international standards on trade should
be maintained within the purview of the WTO

====================

Secondly, we are concerned that the draft resolution
could set the stage for the imposition of conditionalities
or trade regulations that restrict the ability of countries
to fully pursue their international trade relations, The
imposition of non-tariff measures on the basis of human
rights concerns will particularly affect countries such
as Jamaica, which operate open economies and are
heavily dependent upon external trade

====================

Thirdly, the language of the draft resolution does not
take into consideration the fact that there are tradable
items that embody a dual purpose or use. Therefore,
the list of items could be infinite. Establishing the
threshold for proof and identification of such items
would require relevant consultations with military and
security experts

====================

Jamaica remains fully committed to the principles
set out in the United Nations Charter, the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and resolution
72/163. It is noted that resolution 72/163 mandates the
Secretary-General, the Committee against Torture
and the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and
other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment and the Special Rapporteur to submit
reports for consideration by the General Assembly
on their activities related to torture and other cruel,
inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment
during this session and the upcoming session of the
Assembly. Accordingly, my delegation would not wish
to be engaged in a parallel process that may affect
or prejudice the outcomes of the consideration of
those reports

====================

My delegation is further disappointed that the draft
resolution includes references to capital punishment
and seemingly equates this lawful practice to torture. It
will be recalled that there is currently no international

law prohibiting the use of capital punishment. Jamaica
maintains that it is a sovereign right of every country to
decide its own judicial and political systems, taking into
account the country’s unique history, legal traditions
and national circumstances. In this respect, we are
concerned about the unwarranted attempt to target and
modify national legal instruments governing the use of
capital punishment

====================

The draft resolution does not reflect the balance
of interests of all Member States. The current draft
does not sufficiently address or take into consideration
the amendments submitted by Member States during
the informal consultations. My delegation is therefore
concerned that critical issues that have been raised and
which require further analysis and discussion were not
given the required attention during the deliberations
on the draft resolution. Moreover, the draft resolution
envisions the establishment of a group of governmental
experts to examine the feasibility and scope of the goods
to be included and draw up parameters for a range of
options to establish common international standards

====================

My delegation believes that this group of experts is
unlikely to be representative of the widest possible
views on the related issues. We are therefore loathe to
support any draft resolution that may potentially affect
international trade opportunities and our negotiations
conducted under the auspices of the WTO

====================

On a final note, paragraph 4 calls for the cost of
all activities that may arise from the implementation of
the present draft resolution to be met from voluntary
contributions. It would appear that this draft resolution
has the potential to divert funds from the existing
United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture
and from the Special Fund of the Optional Protocol to
the Convention against Torture on which a report by the
Secretary-General is anticipated in the seventy-third
and seventy-fourth sessions of the General Assembly

====================

We would discourage such an approach, which appears
to run counter to our collective commitment to
revitalizing the work of the General Assembly.
