The
Islamic Republic of Iran fully shares the sentiment
that the international community must be vigilant if
it is to prevent the horrors of past mass killings and
genocide from being repeated in future. No one can
forget how inaction on the part of the United Nations in
the face of tragic cases of genocide and crimes against
humanity, as well as outrageous acts of aggression, has
over the past two decades resulted in death, injury or
displacement for millions of innocent people. However,
this has been more a failure on the part of the Security
Council to act when action was needed rather than the
result of the absence of a normative framework or of
the non-implementation of the responsibility to protect

====================

Thus it was inaction on the part of the Security
Council, as a result of a lack of political will on the
part of some of its permanent members, that brought
about the tragic genocide in Rwanda and other
similar catastrophes. The controversies centred on the
responsibility to protect are not rooted in the noble
notion of the prevention of atrocity crimes but rather
in its implementation and the scope of its application

====================

Examining this concept in practical terms can help
us to view it from a better perspective and make this
abstract concept more concrete. Moreover, the discussion
of the responsibility to protect cannot be divorced from
the concept’s political and legal implications. Looking
forward should not relieve us of the responsibility

to look back and remind ourselves of the lessons of
history. We have seen in practice that the responsibility
to protect has been guided by the politicized interests of
certain States rather than by notions of human dignity
and human rights, and it has therefore diverged greatly
from its alleged objectives and purposes. That in turn
has called into question its legitimacy and applicability
as a political tool to be used in times of distress. As a
result, the responsibility to protect is gradually being
developed and seen as a political tool for paving the way
for the selective application of interventionist policies
whenever needed. This is exactly where the concept of
the responsibility to protect faces a real challenge

====================

The normative framework regulating the
prevention of atrocities is already in place. Compliance
with the fundamental principles of international law,
as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations,
contributes to the rule of law at the international
level and builds on the existing bulwark that forms
the very basis of the international legal order. The
main problem lies in illegitimate unilateral action by
certain States, which every now and then creates chaos
in international relations and undermines the existing
normative structure

====================

The illegal use of force blatantly demonstrated in
sudden, unjustified strikes, in flagrant violation of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of States Members
of the United Nations, is a clear example of abuse of the
well-established rules and principles of international
law governing self-defence and the use of force. It
makes it clear that the responsibility to protect has a
dark future if it is designed to be used as a political tool
for furthering the will of a few

====================

The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that we are
still far from having a consensus on our understanding
of the responsibility to protect as a concept. We believe
that before implementing the responsibility to protect,
it is crucial to define its normative framework and
scope of application. The primary responsibility for
preventing the commission of genocide, war crimes,
ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity lies with
sovereign States. This is a core principle of international
law, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations
and articulated in paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005
Summit Outcome document

====================

Other States, or the international community at
large, may step in to prevent such heinous atrocities
upon request, on a case-by-case basis and through the

United Nations. That by no means implies permission
to use force against another State on any pretext, such
as humanitarian intervention, which could pave the way
for all kinds of politically motivated interventions in
other countries. I am sure that no one would like to turn
back the clock to a time when the theory of so-called
just wars prevailed

====================

The prevention of mass atrocity crimes should
remain the core objective of the responsibility to
protect. It should be seen as a long-term strategy, and
it should be interpreted in broad terms and include
mainly non-coercive measures. Even the third pillar
of the responsibility to protect encompasses several
measures that do not necessarily call for coercion. In
that context, the responsibility to protect should be seen
as a framework for helping vulnerable or failed States
to develop their capacity to protect their population and
build safer societies. Prevention involves a broad range
of issues ranging from the promotion of sustainable
development, education and health care to the eradication
of poverty, marginalization and discrimination

====================

The international community should discharge
its responsibility in that respect, particularly through
the provision of demand-driven capacity-building
aimed at strengthening the resilience of societies and
addressing the root causes of conflict. The objective
of the responsibility to protect should not be regime
change but rather the protection of the population,
mainly through the empowerment of societies and a
reduction in inequality. In the limited cases where
coercive measures are needed to save the population,
the responsibility to protect falls within the collective
security framework of the United Nations and can
be authorized only by the Security Council in full
compliance with international law. Authorization by
the Security Council should not be understood as carte
blanche for the commission of fresh atrocities. It also
goes without saying that the Security Council is not
free to selectively opt for the authorization of the use
of force in cases consistent with the will of its member
States or to turn a blind eye to clear situations of mass
atrocities, as we have witnessed in the past and are
still witnessing now

====================

The Security Council is therefore bound by
well-established principles of international law and
should respect the sovereignty of States and their
independence, and action to prevent mass crimes and
atrocities should be seen as a last resort undertaken
only after all efforts to take effective measures at the

national level have been exhausted. The scope of the
application of the responsibility to protect should be
defined in a way that genuinely addresses the plight
of humankind whenever it faces mass atrocity crimes,
free from selectivity and double standards and in full
conformity with the principles and objectives of the
Charter of the United Nations. Addressing the misery
of people under occupation is the most important test of
the responsibility to protect

====================

a tool for legitimizing their interference, aggression
and regime-change ambitions in other Member States,
while now urging for rapid implementation of the
responsibility to protect, on which there is no consensus

====================

In conclusion, the Islamic Republic of Iran insists
on the primacy of the well-established principles of
international law, as enshrined in the Charter of the
United Nations, in all circumstances. We hope that
further discussions on the issue will be held in the
context of efforts to prevent any future abuses of newly
emerging concepts, as we have witnessed in the past
with regard to some of the provisions of the Charter

====================

The Government of the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea will continue to place the interests
of its people at the top of its list of priorities and to
protect and promote their human rights. We take this
opportunity to stress once again that the risk-laden
concept of the responsibility to protect, which has not
been agreed on by all Member States and has been
misused for illegal collective armed intervention based
on political motives, selectivity and double standards,
should no longer be considered as an item on the formal
agenda of the General Assembly

====================

Mr. Ja Song Nam (Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea): I would like to state the position of the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea at this plenary
meeting on the report of the Secretary-General
(A/72/884) on the responsibility to protect and the
prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity

====================

First, we do not support discussions on the
responsibility to protect in the General Assembly as a
formal agenda item because there is no consensus on
it among all States Members of the United Nations. At
the plenary meeting on 15 September (see A/72/PV.2),
the recommendation to include discussion of the
responsibility to protect in the formal agenda of the
General Assembly was approved by a vote, which
makes it clear that the views of Member States on it
continue to differ. We consider it a priority to narrow
gaps through informal debates, as we have not reached
a consensus on the core issues related to the concept of
the responsibility to protect

====================

Secondly, the responsibility to protect peoples
from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and
crimes against humanity is entirely the sovereign
right of a State. It must not be applied in a manner that
interferes in States’ internal affairs. As we have seen in
the Middle East and Africa, some States have created
chaos in developing countries, conducted collective
military invasions on the pretext of protecting civilians
and overthrown legitimate Governments, killing many
civilians and causing the displacement of millions as
refugees. They abuse the responsibility to protect as

Thirdly, root causes such as hunger, poverty,
inequality, discrimination and interference in others’
internal affairs must first be addressed to protect
people from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and
crimes against humanity.
