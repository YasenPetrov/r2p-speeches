I would like to
express my sincere appreciation to the President of
the General Assembly for convening today’s plenary
meeting to debate the responsibility to protect. I would
also like to thank the Secretary-General for his report
(A/72/884) entitled “Responsibility to protect: from

early warning to early action”. We acknowledge that
the purpose of this debate is to foster dialogue, trust
and confidence among States on the matter

====================

the seventy-second session of the General Assembly. I
thank Australia and Ghana. We are pleased to contribute
to this debate today

====================

Since the 2005 World Summit Outcome document,
the international community has been of one mind
about the common goal of preventing and fighting
against genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and
crimes against humanity. Viet Nam strongly condemns
such crimes and is always ready to work with the
international community to protect civilians from
atrocity crimes

====================

The doctrine under discussion affirms States’
responsibility to protect their populations from
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity perpetrated by State or non-State
actors or by their own security forces — and not just the
latter. The first duty of States is the protection of their
populations from actual harm or threats to their safety
and well-being. That is the basis of State legitimacy

====================

But a State fails in its responsibility to protect as much
by failing to use every effective means to protect its
population from harm as by abusing them itself

====================

This happens when States give way to terrorism and
organized crime instead of combating them

====================

Viet Nam is of the view that States have the
primary responsibility to protect their own citizens
from such crimes. The responsibility for early warning
also rests with States first and foremost. However, the
establishment of early-warning measures should be
in accordance with specific national circumstances

====================

We also believe that international assistance is most
effective and sustainable when it is based on the needs
and wishes of the people in the countries concerned and
provided in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations and the principles of international law

====================

Our discussion of this issue should always be guided
by the overriding purpose of the Organization, which is
to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war

====================

In that spirit, we believe that all disputes and differences
should be resolved through peaceful means and in
conformity with international law. At the same time,
it is vital that we address the root causes of conflicts,
ending all forms of discrimination, including ethnic
and religious discrimination. We support initiatives
and international cooperation aimed at hunger
eradication, sustainable development, climate-change
adaptation, capacity-building, the promotion of gender
equality, ensuring the improvement in the conditions
of vulnerable groups and eliminating all forms
of discrimination

====================

We are of the view that the inclusion of the
responsibility to protect as a standing item on the
agenda of the General Assembly should require the
widest possible convergence of views among States
Members of the United Nations. Viet Nam is committed
to engaging in constructive, positive and cooperative
dialogue with all Members States to reach common
ground on these issues on the basis of international law
and the Charter of the United Nations.
