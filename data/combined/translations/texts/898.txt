(spoke in Spanish):
The delegation of Cuba is grateful to the President of
the General Assembly for his good offices in convening
this meeting and for the efforts of the Secretary-General
in preparing his latest report on the responsibility to
protect (A/72/884)

====================

Cuba has repeatedly stated that the issue of the
responsibility to protect continues to present serious
concerns for many countries, particularly small and
developing States, owing to the lack of consensus on

various elements of the concept and their identification,
which can be easily manipulated for political
purposes. It is a fallacy to speak of the principle of
the responsibility to protect. Such a responsibility is
not a principle but a concept whose characteristics,
rules of implementation and assessment mechanisms
are far from being established and agreed. In that
regard, it is inappropriate to speak of strengthening the
implementation of the responsibility to protect in the
absence of a consensus on its scope and implications
that would resolve diverging interpretations, ensure
its universal recognition and acceptance and confer
legitimacy on proposed action for its implementation

====================

It is fitting to underscore the fact that the
international understanding on the responsibility to
protect is circumscribed by paragraphs 138 and 139 of
resolution 60/1, where the concept is restricted to cases
of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity, and which state that the duty of the
international community is to encourage and assist
States in exercising that responsibility, as appropriate

====================

The term “atrocity crimes” is not part of that
understanding and should therefore not be used to
refer to the four cases mentioned in paragraphs 138
and 139. My delegation is concerned that the terms
“atrocity crimes” or “mass atrocities” may be used
selectively and for political purposes to refer to various
situations, given the lack of clarity and agreement on
the United Nations mechanisms and bodies that would
be responsible for their identification and classification

====================

In a United Nations where attempts are made
to impose rather than negotiate and countries are
threatened because of their sovereign decisions, there
is a very valid concern about the lack of definition as
to who decides when there is a need to protect; who
determines that a State is not protecting its population;
and who decides what action is to be taken and on the
basis of what criteria. Nor is it clear so far how we can
ensure that the option to take action is implemented
with the consent of the affected State, so as to avoid
using that concept as a justification for a supposed and
non-existent right to intervene

====================

International efforts to prevent the occurrence
of acts of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or
crimes against humanity — an objective that Cuba has
always shared — should contribute to strengthening the
purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations and international law, in particular sovereign

equality, territorial integrity and self-determination

====================

However, the ambiguities of that concept and the
implications of the exercise of its so-called three
pillars run counter to those purposes and principles

====================

For that reason, the pre-eminence of the principles of
voluntarism, prior request and the consent of States
should be recognized in the context of the responsibility
to protect

====================

If the intention is to prevent, the root causes of
those situations — such as underdevelopment, poverty,
an unjust international economic order, inequality
and social exclusion, hunger, marginalization, food
insecurity or a lack of access to drinking water — should
be addressed, as well as the structural problems that
determine the outbreak of conflicts that escalate to
extreme situations, among others, that, unfortunately,
are not promoted with the same force by many of
those who defend the advancement of the concept of
the responsibility to protect. Those would be real acts
of prevention

====================

Finally, we reiterate that ensuring that the
international community does not remain indifferent in
the face of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and
crimes against humanity is a noble effort. In many cases,
however, the promotion of the responsibility to protect
masks an interest in having yet another tool to facilitate
interference in internal affairs, with agendas for regime
change and subversion in third countries, most of which
are small and developing States. Unfortunately, world
history is replete with sad examples that justify such
a concern.
