UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION
Mr. President,
Four years ago, our Heads of States and Governments adopted unanimously
and irrevocably the principle of the responsibility to protect. By so doing, we
offered a promise of hope to humanity: the promise of a future in which the
words genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity
would be confined to history books. In order to reach this better future, we
promised to assume fully our responsibilities. And we promised to offer each
others a helping hand and to work constructively and in solidarity. Today, I would
like to reflect on these promises

====================

Victims of crimes, whether in Cambodia, in Rwanda or in Ex-Yugoslavia, remind
us that no region, no culture, is safe from the horror engendered by hate and
violence. The promise of hope that was made at the highest level created
expectations for the populations that suffered from these crimes, and the
credibility of our organization depends on our capacity to answer these
expectations

====================

Mr. President,
Answering this promise, and I now move to my second point, is the very goal of
the debate we are holding today. The answer lies in the implementation of what
our leaders decided in 2005. By adopting paragraphs 138 and 139 of the World
Summit Outcome Document, we indeed all pledged to fully assume our
responsibility both at national level, and collectively

====================

As underlined by the Secretary General in his report, the implementation of the
responsibility to protect requires first and foremost national action. The individual
responsibility of States is paramount. There lies the meaning of the concept of
sovereignty as responsibility and of the first pillar. Rather than weakening
sovereignty, the responsibility to protect reinforces it by turning it into responsible
sovereignty

====================

Mr. President,
If a State lacks the means to assume its responsibility on its own - and this
constitutes my third point -, the international community can, the international
community must offer assistance. This solidarity effort is at the heart of the
very principles of the United Nations. It is all the more important in the face of
the various crises - financial and others - which we must currently face together

====================

This responsibility too is impending upon the international community

====================

International and regional assistance are essential and must promote the
"consolidation" of States fully responsible for their citizens. As underlined by the

Secretary General, we must allow national capacities to thrive and take root
rather than support them temporarily and artificially

====================

Regrettably, every now and then, a particular State proves unable or unwilling to
protect its population against the worst crimes. In such circumstances, we
cannot forfeit our collective responsibility. On the contrary, we have to display
our solidarity with civilian populations. In such circumstances, the
international community must use all means at its disposal to react, including, but
as a last resort, coercive measures. The collective exercise of responsibility is
one of the promises we made to the victims in 2005 and which we cannot disown
today

====================

This leads me to my fourth and last point, Mr. President: implementation

====================

Implementation lies at the center of today's debate, not the principle of the
responsibility to protect itself. Belgium will not accept any backtracking on the
unanimous agreement of 2005. As the Secretary General rightly stated during
the presentation of his report, "it is high time to turn the promise of responsibility
to protect into practice". Belgium would like to join the other delegations in
thanking the Secretary General for his commitment and for the excellent report
which we are considering today. Most of the activities proposed by the report are
known to us and are already pursued in some form in full respect of the Charter,
whether in the field of mediation, conflict prevention, peacekeeping or peace
building. Whether they relate to the first, the second or the third pillar, they form
much of the daily work of the United Nations. Other proposals, as that to develop
our early warning and prevention capacity deserve to be rapidly implemented

====================

More than ever, we must undertake this task with determination and conviction

====================

We promised it to the victims of odious crimes

====================

Mr. President,
This was the message that Belgium wanted to convey on the occasion of this
debate in addition to the statement made by Sweden on behalf of the European
Union, statement to which we fully subscribe
