(spoke in Spanish):
Spain aligns itself with the statements made earlier
by the observer of the European Union and by the
representative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of
Friends on the Responsibility to Protect

====================

This is an important meeting for several reasons

====================

First, this is the first formal debate in the Assembly
since 2009 on the responsibility to protect, which is
an issue directly related to the most relevant functions
and commitments of the Organization. Protecting
populations at risk of genocide, crimes against
humanity, war crimes or ethnic cleansing is and
should be a priority for the United Nations. In Syria,
Iraq, the Central African Republic, Myanmar and
Yemen, we are witnessing daily the ravages caused by
extreme and indiscriminate violence, the persecution
of communities because of their ethnicity or religion
and the violation of international humanitarian law
and human rights law. That reality is what leads us to
believe that this agenda item should be a permanent one
in order to show our commitment to the discussion and
implementation of proposals in this area

====================

Secondly, this meeting is important because it
allows us to highlight the centrality of the preventive
element highlighted by the Secretary-General. My
country supports the three pillars of the responsibility
to protect. Today we are emphasizing the crosscutting preventive element, because, as we have seen
in Myanmar, for example, the costs of failing to act in
time are simply unacceptable

====================

Spain supports appropriate institutionalization in
the United Nations in the area of the responsibility to
protect through the figure of the Secretary-General’s
Special Adviser, with access to all the necessary
information. I would also like to take this opportunity
to thank Mr. Šimonović for his excellent work in
that capacity up until March. Spain also supports
concrete initiatives, such as those articulated by the
Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, on the
preventive role that religious leaders can also play

====================

Thirdly, the meeting is important because reality
shows us that we must strengthen the links between
the various pillars of the Organization, and particularly
between the maintenance of international peace
and security and human rights, if we are to develop
a properly coordinated prevention policy. Let me
underline today the importance of the Human Rights
Council and its special mechanisms and procedures

====================

Human rights do not contradict sovereignty; on the
contrary, their protection is the primary responsibility
of any sovereign State

====================

Fourthly and lastly, this is an important meeting
because we are concerned about negative trends that
are repeated by the parties to conflicts — trends such
as the systematic use of forced displacement, the use
of hunger as a weapon of war and the use of sexual
violence as a tactic of war and terrorism. Those patterns
of action could constitute crimes against humanity, war
crimes or genocide

====================

Let me conclude with some concrete proposals

====================

First, we attached great importance to the responsibility
to protect during our service a short time ago on the
Security Council, when Spain was a non-permanent
member. Together with Chile, we organized the first
meeting of the Council on this issue under the Arria
Formula. We now call on the members of the Security
Council to maximize the possibilities offered by our
working methods to incorporate that perspective. That
requires the use of the code of conduct and the restriction
of the veto, the organization of Arria Formula meetings
or the invitation of specific speakers when dealing with
high-risk situations

====================

We also believe that we should explore how the
Informal Expert Group on the Protection of Civilians
and the Informal Expert Group on Women and Peace
and Security, as well as the Working Group on Children
and Armed Conflict, can systematically incorporate the
responsibility to protect approach, when that is relevant

====================

In the area of the protection of civilians and peace
operations, I want to stress the importance of mandates
to protect women and children and the inclusion of
atrocity crimes in predeployment training, and that
any review should guided by the protection needs of
civilians. We also support the implementation of the
Kigali Principles on the Protection of Civilians and call
for compliance with Security Council resolution 2286
(2016), on the protection of medical equipment and

facilities in armed conflict. We also urge more States
to sign the Safe Schools Declaration

====================

I would also like to encourage the use of a
responsibility-to-protect perspective in the discourse
justifying our migration policies. Spain is trying to
do that, and has therefore provided a humanitarian
response to a specific crisis and is working to expand
that approach to the whole of the European Union

====================

I should not end without mentioning accountability

====================

Spain reaffirms its recognition of the work of the
International Criminal Court in this, the year of the
twentieth anniversary of the Rome Statute. We call
on all States to cooperate with all mechanisms of
investigation, collection and preservation of evidence,
with the aim of facilitating accountability in the near
future, including in the cases of Syria and Iraq

====================

Finally, we sometimes engage in conceptual
debates that do not contribute to concrete results. To
countries that have reservations about this issue, I
would humbly say that the responsibility to protect is
not merely a function of the third pillar, and neither
is the third pillar limited to military intervention. The
question is not whether the responsibility to protect
applies to a particular situation, as States always have
the responsibility to protect their populations. What is
truly crucial and important is how to use the measures
available under each pillar to prevent and respond to
heinous crimes that we all wish to avoid.
