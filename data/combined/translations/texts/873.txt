(spoke in French): At
the outset, I would like to congratulate the President of
the General Assembly on the convening of this meeting

and the outstanding leadership of our work. Allow
me also to congratulate Secretary-General António
Guterres on the high quality of his enlightening report
on the responsibility to protect (A/73/898). I wish to
reiterate my delegation’s readiness to contribute to the
success of this meeting

====================

Côte d’Ivoire aligns itself with the statement made
by the representative of Denmark on behalf of the
Group of Friends on the Responsibility to Protect (see
A/73/PV.93)

====================

The holding of this meeting on the responsibility
to protect (R2P) proves once again the United Nations
commitment to ensuring that our peoples will live in a
good world, a world of peace and serenity. Unfortunately,
we cannot but note that the responsibility to protect,
which became a norm of public international law
through its adoption in 2005 during the World Summit
by the States Members of the United Nations, has been
unable to put an end to war crimes and crimes against
humanity or to ease the many hotbeds of tension
throughout our planet

====================

The threat of armed clashes, genocide and ethnic
cleansing, often met with complete indifference
by the international community, are the daily lot
characterizing many of the issues inscribed on the
agenda of the United Nations. We must therefore use
this meeting as a call to action to avert tragedies such as
those that have been seen in certain parts of the world

====================

Indeed, recent history has taught us, unfortunately, that
on many occasions States have not been able to protect
their populations or have been passive witnesses to, or
even active actors in, grave and unacceptable violations
of international human rights and humanitarian law

====================

Following the Summit in 2005, the General
Assembly unanimously adopted in 2009 resolution
63/308, entitled “The responsibility to protect”, with the
goal of effectively fighting such tragedies. Nevertheless,
we cannot but note that the implementation of the R2P
concept has given rise to divergent views in the United
Nations owing to the differences that could emerge
between this idea and the principle of non-interference
into the domestic affairs of States. Such differences
require us to continue our discussions so as to arrive at
a specific definition of the precise criteria for impartial
and objective decision-making mechanisms, so that we
can avoid all speculation in case of resort to this concept

====================

We must stress that the sovereignty of States entails
respect for their international commitments, including

respect for and the safeguarding of international
human rights law, and its corollary, the responsibility
to protect civilians

====================

By becoming a member of the Group of Friends
of the Responsibility to Protect in 2012, Côte d’Ivoire
reaffirmed its commitment to respect for this principle
and reiterated its willingness to support all actions
aimed at its implementation through good-offices
missions and peacekeeping operations

====================

I wish also to recall that during the crisis in Côte
d’Ivoire, the Security Council, through resolution 1975
(2011) of 30 March 2011, because of the atrocities
committed, ordered, inter alia, a military intervention
to protect civilians and property. Given our difficult
past, my delegation is of the view that prevention is an
essential means of averting the commission of the worst
kind of atrocities that have been seen in our world

====================

In that respect, the international community should
be proactive and prioritize the fight against hate speech
and the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons

====================

The United Nations must therefore rely more on
early-warning mechanisms and ramp up cooperation
with regional and subregional organizations and civil
society. Cooperation with such organizations will make
it possible to identify and address their needs in terms
of leaders’ capacity-building and financial support, so
as to make them more operational on the ground

====================

In West Africa, the Economic Community of
West African States has a number of mechanisms
for conflict prevention and the protection of peoples,
in particular, the early-warning mechanism of the
Mediation and Security Council, the Office of the
Special Representative and the Council of the Wise, as
well as the special mediators. Nevertheless, it must be
acknowledged that the existence of these mechanisms,
despite the fact that they are vital, has not always been
able to prevent conflicts, with tragic consequences

====================

The resort to force is the final alternative for achieving
peace and saving lives when the State that has the
primary responsibility to protect is not able to do so

====================

I wish to note that today the trend is to shrink the
budget of United Nations peacekeeping operations,
which, needless to say, remain a vital tool for the
United Nations and whose operationalization has
allowed the international community to implement
the responsibility to protect and save many lives. Let
us keep in mind the fact that beyond the budgetary

constraints facing the United Nations, no sacrifice is
too great to preserve humankind from mass atrocities.
