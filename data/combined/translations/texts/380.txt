Responsibility to protect as contained respectively at 4 (h) of the Act

that much remains to be done to integrate R2P into the grooves of the
global governance

Member States to nominate Focal Points for R2P, and finally, my country supports

resolutions to stop mass atrocities as identified
in the concept of R2P
