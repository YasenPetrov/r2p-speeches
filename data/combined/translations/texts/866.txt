At the outset, we
would like to thank the Secretary-General for this
year’s report on the responsibility to protect (R2P),
with a special emphasis on lessons learned for
prevention (A/73/898). This discussion on R2P serves
as yet further confirmation of its importance for the
international community. It is difficult to overestimate
its significance in the light of the persistent, and
sometimes widening, gap between the commitments
and actions of some United Nations States Members

====================

Ukraine aligns itself with the statement delivered
yesterday on behalf of the European Union (see A/73/
PV.93). We would like to add a few remarks in our
national capacity

====================

Ukraine is a party to the core instruments of
international law relating to the prevention of atrocity
crimes, the protection of populations, upholding human
rights and the elimination of all forms of discrimination

====================

We removed internal legal obstacles in the way of
Ukraine’s ratification of the Rome Statute of the
International Criminal Court and are actively working
on the preparation of legislation aimed at implementing
the Statute

====================

The R2P principles fully exclude any possibility of
the use of military forces by one State against another
State under the pretext of the protection of its population
from imagined threats with the actual sole goal of

annexing another State’s territory. There are criteria
for the legitimacy of the use of force, such as just cause,
the right intention, as a last resort, the proportionality
of means and a reasonable prospect of success. What is
important to highlight is that military force must not be
used to alter borders or pursue occupation

====================

Nevertheless, the exploitation of R2P in violation of
the Charter of the United Nations principles continues
to take place. The military actions of the Russian
Federation in Ukraine, under the sociocultural pretext
of protecting Russian-speaking Ukrainians, are a clear
example of that. It is nothing more than a crude and
unsuccessful attempt of employing certain elements of
R2P to justify its armed aggression

====================

The General Assembly, in its resolutions in relation
to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, has affirmed its
commitment to the sovereignty, political independence,
unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its
internationally recognized borders and has condemned
the temporary occupation of the Autonomous Republic
of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol by the Russian
Federation. The adoption of those resolutions means
that the United Nations family is not going to tolerate
the manipulation of R2P principles

====================

Russia’s supply of weapons and ammunition to its
armed formations in occupied Ukrainian Donbas and
their daily attacks and shelling, which threaten the
lives of the civilian population, are crimes under the
principle of R2P. The ongoing occupation of parts of
its territory limits Ukraine’s ability to implement R2P
pillar I

====================

The Russian occupation regime continues to deny
access to international human rights observers in
Crimea, including the United Nations Human Rights
Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. In the context of
today’s discussion, it is worth mentioning that human
rights and humanitarian presence constitute a critical
part of a prevention mechanism, which, in addition
to monitoring, can also identify risks of a sharp
deterioration of the situation and make respective
recommendations for early action

====================

In that regard, we again urge the Russian Federation
to reverse the occupation of Crimea and Sevastopol, as
well as territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions,
and to stop its aggression, including by withdrawing
its armed formations from the temporarily occupied
territories and fully implementing its commitments
under the Minsk agreements. In addition, we urge the

release of Ukrainian military servicemen and naval
vessels, as well as all political prisoners held in Russia
and in occupied Crimea and Donbas

====================

Turning to pillar II, and especially pillar III, we
would like to highlight the role of the United Nations,
through its organs, in preventing atrocity crimes. A
special responsibility for that rests with the Security
Council. However, the use of the veto, or even the
mere threat of its use, can stall the Council’s response
in situations where urgent action is needed to protect
civilians. In that regard, we would like to reiterate our
strong position on the need to phase out the veto, as a
major obstacle to the Council’s ability to act efficiently
in certain situations

====================

We have supported all kinds of ideas against the
misuse or abuse of the veto power. For instance, we
fully share the respective French-Mexican initiative
and the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency
group’s code of conduct regarding Security Council
action against genocide, crimes against humanity and
war crimes. However, we are also convinced that the
use of the veto should also be restricted in cases when
a permanent member is directly involved in a conflict
under consideration by the Council or if it is a party to
a dispute, and therefore cannot be expected to exercise
its voting rights and privileges in an impartial manner

====================

Nevertheless, in the current state of affairs, it
is quite possible that the Security Council will again
fail to act as it did on too many occasions already

====================

Therefore, the General Assembly should be ready
to assume its responsibility and play its role. In that
regard, strengthened and improved awareness on the
part of Member States regarding the risks of atrocity
crimes, recommendations on the prevention of such
crimes and mechanisms to support such steps could
greatly enhance the General Assembly’s ability to take
fair, just, efficient and results-oriented decisions in the
proper implementation of R2P.
