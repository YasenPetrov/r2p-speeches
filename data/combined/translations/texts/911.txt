(spoke in Chinese):
China listened carefully to Ms. Viotti’s statement
(see A/73/PV.93) and took note of the SecretaryGeneral’s report on the issue of the responsibility
to protect (A/73/898). We would like to make the
following observations

====================

Pursuant to international law, Governments have
the primary responsibility to protect their citizens,
which is a role that is irreplaceable. The international
community should abide by the purposes and principles
of the Charter of the United Nations, fully respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries
concerned and uphold the fundamental principles that
govern international relations, such as non-interference
in internal affairs, non-aggression and the peaceful
settlement of disputes. The will and leadership of the
countries concerned should be fully respected and
constructive assistance should be provided to them. All
parties should strive to resolve their differences through
dialogue, consultation and political negotiation and
should prevent conflicts, resolve disputes peacefully,
reduce armed conflicts, foster the concept of a
common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable
security and build a community for the shared future
of humankind

====================

Prevention is the key to implementing the
responsibility to protect (R2P). We should step up our
efforts to focus more on prevention and vigorously
address both the symptoms and the root causes of
conflict. As stated in the report of the SecretaryGeneral, we should take preventive measures in various
fields, including the eradication of extreme poverty
and uneven development. We should build inclusive
societies, strengthen national capacity-building,
resolve problems by political means and fully leverage
the role of United Nations agencies and regional and
subregional organizations

====================

Development is a fundamental priority. All countries
should prioritize development and work together to
promote the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development, enhance the capacity of
developing countries to achieve their own development
and reduce and eradicate poverty at a global level so
as to build a foundation for conflict prevention. At the
same time, the international community should strive
to build a vision of civilization that promotes mutual
respect and equality. We should support equality and
respect, abandon arrogance and prejudice and promote

openness, tolerance and mutual learning in building an
inclusive social culture

====================

According to the 2005 World Summit Outcome
document, the responsibility to protect is strictly
limited to four kinds of crimes: genocide, war crimes,
ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. That
formulation is a balanced compromise negotiated
by all countries and a hard-won consensus, which
should not be subject to wilful expansion, much less
misinterpretation or abuse. Member States have not
yet agreed on the definition of and criteria for R2P

====================

Informal discussions, led by Member States, should
therefore continue. Consensus should be gradually
forged in order to avoid forcing issues onto the agenda
of the General Assembly. The persistent promotion and
imposition of controversial issues will only harm the
common interest of Member States

====================

China would like to underline once again that the use
of force in enforcement measures and the authorization
to use force should be considered only when all peaceful
measures have been exhausted. It should also be in
line with the provisions of the Charter of the United
Nations. Military action taken by the international
community to protect civilians must be authorized by
the Security Council with strict conditions attached and
explicit methods of implementation, which should be
considered on a case-by-case basis.
