Muchas gracias.- The Delegation of Uruguay would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly
for convening this debate and the Secretary-General for his report. We welcome the presence of
the new Special Advisor for Responsibility to Protect, Jennifer Welsh, and we wish her the best
in her new role and offer her the full collaboration of the Delegation of Uruguay that is within
our reach

====================

The focus attached to the responsibility of the State and prevention is extremely important for
various reasons:

- Firstly because it allows to highlight a key aspect of the concept of responsibility to protect that
tends to receive less attention at the expense of the possibility to resort to coercive Measures,
such as the reaffirmation of national sovereignty which derives from the responsibility of each
State to protect their population

====================

- Additionally, because it focuses in prevention measures, which is a much more preferable
alternative to reaction, but which is highly complex, as it has to take into account different latent
risk factors, long-term political and institutional and, in certain cases, the construction of a true
or new social contract

====================

- Although the three R2P pillars cannot be conceived as blocked compartments, this focus on the
first pillar also allows us, at least for a moment, to appreciate everything or much of what the
concept implies that is not related to the use of force. Detaching it from imprecise associations
with notions that have nothing to do with the 2005 consensus, such as the pretext of the
external use of force in order to comply with other aims that are not to prevent or stop mass
atrocities, including regime change

====================

The Secretary-General's report and today's debate show us with diverse examples what
we States can do, taking into account the special cireumstances of each of us, to reinforce our
responsibility to protect. However, my Delegation considers that there are certain repeating
elements, elements that if present in a society, the chances of mass violation of Human Rights
would be highly minimized

====================

- The strengthening of the Rule of Law and institutions in charge of its implementation,
especially those related to the promotion and protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms, in particular the freedom of expression and freedom of association

====================

- An independent Justice, able to address complex cases of criminal responsibility and, failing to
do so, the disposition to activate in a timely manner the international criminal jurisdiction,
which would help not only to address possible situations of impunity, but also, as a deterrent
element to prevent future mass atrocities. An example of this, in the case of the actions by the
national justice and regional mechanisms, is what happened in my country and others of the
region with the judgment of crimes against humanity committed in the 70s. - Inclusive political dialogues that support reconciliation processes, capables of managing
possible tensions that may emerge between accountability and political stability and with special
sensitivity on the rights of minorities

====================

- Transparent and fair electoral processes

====================

- Economic and social development projects that promote integration and the reduction of social
disparities

====================

In these and a number of other areas, the international community could and should help. In
this respect, there are already numerous mechanisms within and outside the UN, that pre-date
the emergence of the R2P concept, that would benefit in their effectiveness if the mass atrocities
prevention's perspective is included in them

====================

However, we cannot ignore that it is imperative to address the cases in which this primary
responsibility and prevention fail, when a State openly mis-interpret the principle of sovereignty
and its corollary of non intervention, contradicting universal principles and jus cogens norms
related to the respect of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as we witness today. This
debate must continue in the United Nations, specially here at the General Assembly in a more
regular and institutionalized basis
