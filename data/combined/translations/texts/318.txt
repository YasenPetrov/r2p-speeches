New York, September 8, 2015

====================

First let me congratulate you and express place the sincerest
Cuba appreciation for his commendable work as Chairman of the session
69 of the UN General Assembly will conclude in the coming days

====================

With regard to the topic at hand the delegation of Cuba would ratify
that the General Assembly is the forum indicated for an examination
depth genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and
crimes against humanity; which constitute heinous crimes
to repudiate

====================

However it is intended to include the item on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, as a
Topic, to monitor and evaluate compliance. that proposal
I could only be acceptable if it was directed to build consensus on the
content and scope of R2P, and to give greater weight to said UNGA
process

====================

Cuba wishes to make clear that there is no mandate for the inclusion in the
Office for the Prevention of Genocide, care and office set
for the Responsibility to Protect

====================

The report on which we discussed today interactively, call the
implementation of R2P and to put aside discussions on its scope and
content, which contradicts the mandate contained in paragraph 139 of the
60/1 document. It should not be waived by the General Assembly reaches
consensus on R2P to resolve differences of interpretation on
the same, to ensure their recognition and universal acceptance and grant
legitimacy to the actions proposed for implementation

====================

During this debate we could not aspire to States to implement the
concept and the pillars of the Responsibility to Protect, when there is nothing
which obliges them to do so. It is not possible to accept recommendations on this issue
when we have never accepted the concept as a principle, and it seems
appropriate to go beyond adopted at the Millennium Summit 2005

====================

Mr. president; Cuba does not share some approaches to the report, which assume certain
majority or even consensus on many issues acceptance
related to the Responsibility to Protect, and that in several cases
beyond intergovernmentally agreed to the deal, for example,
issue of human rights, international humanitarian law and
peacekeeping or peacebuilding

====================

Technically a raise error at the 2005 World Summit adopted
the principle of responsibility to protect. The Summit was established
as a State responsibility to protect its population from the
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity, which is different. It was also legitimized as a duty and a
responsibility for the international community, as appropriate, encourage and
help States to exercise this responsibility

====================

Are numerous and legitimate concerns that the issue of
Responsibility to Protect (R2P) raises and that can not be ignored

====================

In that context, then we moved just a few considerations
regard to the Report for the sake of time:

e It is wrong to assert that the Responsibility to Protect is a
principle of international law. Ambiguities about the
term and possible implications of the exercise of their so-called
three pillars confirm the frank contradictions with the principles of
the United Nations Charter and International Law

====================

+ There is no balanced treatment of what is defined as three
pillars of the concept

====================

and to the address the importance of prevention, there is no reference to
raigales causes that generate the situations mentioned, nor
address structural problems that determine the outbreak of
conflicts that scale to extreme situations

====================

The report places and crimes against humanity (using the term
"Heinous crimes" which has no internationally recognized definition)
as a root cause of serious humanitarian emergencies, crisis,
refugee flows, internal displacement and destabilization

====================

No mention, however, the incidence in these situations
emergency structural causes such as extreme poverty,
hunger, economic inequality, food insecurity or
negative consequences of climate change

====================

+ It strongly promotes the need for resources for
monitoring and early warning in conflict situations and situations
risky; however, it not with violence promotes the strengthening of national capacities for development
economic development of the most backward countries

====================

+ Enel report is not clear who determines that certain situations
They constitute imminent risk to commit crimes against
humanity. The existence per se of armed conflict, displaced
or refugees, not necessarily determines the occurrence of the
mentioned crimes

====================

+ It redefines the main goal of the responsibility to protect
It is posing as a concept that reinforces the sovereignty of
States, when really in many ways it is detrimental
this principle

====================

+ It is very worrying that the report seeks support for
UN preventive deployment, without specifying
specifically referred to in these

====================

+ The terminology used in the report departs from the terminology
agreed as to the operations peacekeeping

====================

+ Also, it is endorsing the recommendations of the Panel
Independent of Peacekeeping Operations. This document has not yet been
debated and much less approved by Member States

====================

Enel + text of the report is given to intergovernmental bodies
United Nations and particularly the Security Council,
functions that were not attributed to him

====================

We could be several hours telling our specific criteria
with respect to each of the paragraphs of this report, but time does not
It allows. Cuba considers that this text is intended to leap very
dangerous in terms of Responsibility to Protect

====================

Mr. president,

Cuba, a country poor and blockaded, still willing to work so
consistent with the international community and the United Nations not
remain indifferent and inactive to genocide, war crimes,
ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity; but at the same time
insist on the real danger exists that the Responsibility to Protect
end up being manipulated by covert interventionists seeking
justify interference in different ways and use of force
