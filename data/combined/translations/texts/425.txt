UNITED NATIONS
PRESS RELEASE

Statement by the Special Advisers of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide,
Mr. Adama Dieng, and on the Responsibility to Protect, Ms. Jennifer Welsh, on the
situation in Israel and in the Palestinian Occupied Territory of Gaza Strip

====================

(New York, 24 July 2014) The Special Advisers of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of
Genocide, Adama Dieng, and on the Responsibility to Protect, Jennifer Welsh, express their
serious concern at the escalation of violence in the occupied Gaza strip and at the targeting of
civilians in the current crisis

====================

“We express shock at the high number of civilians killed and injured in the ongoing Israeli
operations in Gaza and at the rocket attacks launched by Hamas and other Palestinian armed
groups in Israeli civilian areas.” According to latest UN reports, fighting has resulted in the
killing of 697 Palestinians including over 500 civilians, of whom at least 170 are children and 86
women. According to Israeli sources, a total of 29 Israeli soldiers and three civilians have been
killed, since the hostilities started on 7 July. Homes, schools, medical facilities and basic
infrastructure, including United Nations facilities have been destroyed by military bombardments
in the Gaza Strip by the Israeli forces

====================

Dieng and Welsh stated that the high number of civilian casualties, particularly among the
Palestinians, could demonstrate disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force by the Israeli
Defence Forces. At the same time, the launching of rocket attacks by Hamas and other
Palestinian armed groups into Israeli residential areas constitutes indiscriminate use of force. In
this context, “both parties are in violation of international humanitarian law and international
human rights law, and these acts could constitute atrocity crimes”, the two Special Advisers
observed

====================

The Special Advisers urge all parties to adhere to the principles of distinction between civilians
and combatants, and between civilian objects and military objectives. They also call upon the
Israeli Defence Forces to fully respect the principle of proportionality

====================

“We are equally disturbed by the flagrant use of hate speech in the social media, particularly
against the Palestinian population,” stated the Special Advisers. According to reliable reports,
individuals have disseminated messages that could be dehumanising to the Palestinians and have
called for the killing of members of this group. The Special Advisers remind all that incitement
to commit atrocity crimes is prohibited under international law

====================

Israel, as the Occupying Power, the Palestinian Authority, and Hamas, have the responsibility to
protect the population in Gaza. The Special Advisers call on the three parties to take immediate
measures to ensure the protection of the population. Taking into consideration the dire
humanitarian and human rights crisis in Gaza, the international community also has a
responsibility to assist in protecting the civilian population, first and foremost by encouraging
1

and supporting negotiations towards a ceasefire, and by ensuring the delivery of humanitarian
aid

====================

“The actions of all parties need to be thoroughly and impartially investigated, and those found
responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity, on either side, must be held accountable
for their actions. Impunity for crimes committed in the past has had a lingering negative effect in
this region. ” noted the Special Advisers. To achieve protection of the population in the region,
the Special Advisers call for an end of hostilities, the creation of a humanitarian corridor, and
lifting of the blockade of Gaza which has created further suffering. The Special Advisers call on
the parties to return to serious negotiations that will end the cycle of violence and achieve a
stable, just and durable solution to this longstanding conflict
