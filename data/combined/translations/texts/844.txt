(spoke in Arabic): My
country reaffirms its respect for all human rights as the
inherent and global rights of humankind that preserve
human dignity and safeguard people’s physical and
mental integrity

====================

My country was one of the first to join the
Convention against Torture, on 16 May 1989. In line
with the Convention, we have adopted effective
legislative, administrative and judicial measures aimed

at preventing torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment

====================

Resolution 73/304 seeks to put an end to the trade
in goods that could be used for torture. However, the
resolution does not take into account the concerns of
many States and hence consensus was not established

====================

We abstained in the voting on the resolution for the
following reasons

====================

First, in its operative part the resolution establishes a
link between torture and capital punishment, which are
two completely different issues when considered from
a legal and objective perspective. Indeed, it contradicts
international conventions and national legislation

====================

Torture, according to the Convention against Torture, is
“any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether
physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a
person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a
third person information or a confession, punishing
him for an act he or a third person has committed or
is suspected of having committed”

====================

Capital punishment is carried out in accordance
with national laws in order to deter perpetrators and as
a result of a judgment that condemns them of the most
heinous crimes leading to the death of other human
beings. Such judgments are applicable only in the case
of the most serious crimes

====================

Secondly, it would appear that the text of the
resolution, especially its title, is aimed at the renunciation
of torture in all its forms. We all agree with that

====================

However, it obscures the ambiguity of its provisions,
as the resolution identifies a linkage between human
rights, on the one hand, and international trade, on the
other, by seeking to establish international standards
that might be politicized while having serious and longterm repercussions on international trade.
