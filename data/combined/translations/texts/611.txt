In the final document of the 2005 World Summit, in paragraph 139,
It establishes a gradual concept of responsibility to protect and stands
the central role of prevention. However, international attention on the
currently it focuses on the most extreme situations, those who fall into the
Chapter VII of the Charter

====================

The Security Council is the cornerstone for the use of force in situations
conflict and therefore must take into account the limits resulting from the
power relations, since the Council has not been in the possibility of taking
actions or even rule on very serious situations that are

Protect is respect for the rule of law at national and international levels. I dont know
You should forget that admissions standards are right, and especially the Charter
United Nations, which should govern any action

====================

Linked to this, it is the fight against impunity. Criminal Court
International faces problems in meeting their sentences
questioning not only its credibility but also the UN as a whole

====================

Thus the risk is increased that violations committed again
