Statement by Ambassador
R. P. of Spain, Fernando Arias
Informal Interactive Dialogue of the General Assembly on the Report of the
Secretary-General on the Responsibility to Protect:
decisive and timely response
05.09.2012
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I wish my first words of
recognition of the work performed by the previous Special Advisory
Secretary General for the Responsibility to Protect, Mr. Edward Luck and the
Prevention of Genocide, Francis Deng. My congratulations, Mr. President, for your
recent appointment as Secretary General Advisor for the Prevention of the
Genocide. I wish you the greatest success in management and know you can count
with the full support of Spain

====================

Spain fully associates itself with the intervention of the European Union and its
national capacity you want to add some considerations

====================

Spain strongly supports the concept of responsibility to protect such
As he outlined by the Heads of State and Government at the World Summit
2005, and as has been defined in the successive reports
General secretary. In the same way Spain has supported instances
Relevant United Nations system when invoked this principle
to urge States to fulfill the responsibility that the exercise of the
sovereignty entails

====================

Today mentioned the concept of sovereignty as responsibility. Well
However, the exercise of "irresponsible sovereignty" and calls for decisive action
timely by the international community. I will echo the words of the
Secretary General to the talk today about the suffering of the Syrian people: inaction
It is not an option. Inaction erodes the faith of our citizens in the system
United Nations

====================

Mr President, as we have seen during the debate, although the concept of
RtoP is fully seated still need to forge a consensus on
methods of their application. It is important to recognize the different
sensitivities of Member States or regional groups. In this regard, both the
initiative launched by Brazil, Responsalbilidad to the Protect, as the report of the
Secretary General brings clarity: RtoP principles must be applied
maximum consistency and uniformity. However, the choice of instruments
employees, not excluding a priori any of those Nations Charter
United it makes available to the international community, will depend on the
specific circumstances

====================

According to these criteria my delegation considers, Mr. President,
where there has been invoked the concept of RtoP, as in the case of Libya, such
As the distinguished delegate recognized Libya this morning, or the case of Costa
Ivory brilliantly exposed by Ambassador Bamba, your application must be
seen as a success of the United Nations and the international community

====================

It is essential to recognize that the invocation of the third pillar, ie the
timely and decisive subject of our discussion today, contains a response
wide range of options. It behooves us to reflect to define between all
more clearly the terms, conditions, requirements, possibilities, degree

execution and as well mentioned the Secretary General Simoniovic, the
consequences of the chosen option. It would be wrong to limit debate on the
instruments to use coercive measures, and within these the
military dimension: it distorts the concept of RtoP
Among these measures Spain attached particular importance to diplomacy
preventive and mediation obvious example of the correlation between the pillars
second and third

====================

In this regard let me recall that during the ministerial week 67
AG, on 28 September, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation
Spain, with his Moroccan counterpart, will make the launch of the initiative
for mediation in the region of the Mediterranean. This initiative, which was announced
within the framework of the 66th AG and has the participation of the General Secretariat,
It has the vocation to the development of national capacities in
mediation and coordination between the various actors in the Mediterranean

====================

Finally I would like to ask the panelists feedback on two
aspects of the report that I consider particularly interesting and yet not have
been the subject of much attention during the day:
First, most dialogue with civil society, that enriches the debate and
can facilitate early warning and effective response

====================

And finally the leading role of humanitarian agencies, whose action without
But it should not be a substitute for political action itself RtoP, not
You are confused with it. Unlike this, the humanitarian response is governed
by own principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality and
its effectiveness depends on humanitarian space is guaranteed
