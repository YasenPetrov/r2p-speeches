Thank you Mister Chair,
Let me start by thanking the Secretary-General for his report on
“Implementing the Responsibility to Protect: Accountability for
Prevention”

====================

Georgia has been continuously supporting the principle of responsibility
to protect and has been participating in the network of national focal
points on R2P. Therefore, we are glad to observe increased commitment
to this principle worldwide. As the report notes, Consensus about the
purposes of the responsibility to protect spans every continent and there
is no longer any question that the protection of populations from atrocity
crimes is both a national and international responsibility

====================

We welcome Secretary-General’s increased focus on Pillar I and his
emphasis on prevention agenda. Georgia is a country that has suffered
from several waves of ethnic cleansing due to the foreign military
occupation, where thousands of persons inside the occupied territories
face regular human rights violations and the risk of forced displacement

====================

Against this background, we fully understand the importance of strong

national and international preventive tools to avert the outbreak and
protraction of crises that take such a heavy toll on humanity

====================

We concur with the Secretary-General in his finding that all three
components of accountability for atrocity prevention – moral, legal and
political are vital and should be addressed by Member States and
international community with resolve. It is also important to recognize
the link between the R2P and the 2030 Agenda, particularly with the Goal
16 on peaceful, just and inclusive societies. Developing transparent,
accountable and inclusive institutions is at the core of these efforts

====================

Georgia is committed to advance its relevant national mechanisms, be it
through the ratification of the core instruments of international human
rights and humanitarian law or putting in place national human rights
institutions to address atrocity prevention. Human Rights Treaty Bodies
have a particular importance to this end. Georgia has issued a standing
invitation to all Special Procedures and has been regularly accepting visits
from various Special Rapporteurs, the most recent of them being the
Special Rapporteur on IDPs and SR on Violence against Women, to name
the few. The Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review Process is
another significant cornerstone among these efforts. Notably, we have
already entered the third cycle of UPR

====================

Distinguished Delegates,
As the report rightly notes, “there remains too much of a gap between
the solemn commitments and legal obligations of Member States and
actual lived experience of vulnerable populations.” In this context, let
me recall the dire situation of people living on the other side of the
occupation line in the two Georgian regions of Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali
region/South Ossetia. Despite numerous calls from international
community, including the latest Human Rights Council Resolution on
Georgia, both occupied regions remain closed for international human
rights bodies, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,
while the people on the ground face grave violations of freedom of
movement, restrictions on education in native language, deprivation of
property rights, unlawful detentions and more. This situation creates an
acute risks that could potentially grow into atrocity crimes and requires
stronger international attention. The responsibility of Member States to

assist is of paramount importance in this regard, especially as we address
the cases, when a sovereign state is prevented from exercising its
responsibility due to foreign military occupation

====================

!
In conclusion let me touch upon the critical role of the Security Council in
sustaining peace. It is imperative that the Security Council is able to act
in a timely and efficient manner to avert mass atrocities. In this context,
we reiterate our full support to the French-Mexican initiative on
voluntary veto right restriction to prevent these crimes

====================

Finally, let me reiterate Georgia’s commitment to advance the goals and
objectives of responsibility to protect and support the Secretary-General
in his endeavor to integrate atrocity prevention into the UN prevention
platform

====================

I thank you

====================
