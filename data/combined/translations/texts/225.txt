Statement delivered by the Delegation of the Mexico to the United Nations, at the United
Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion on "From commitment to
implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened by the President of
the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
26 February 2016
Mr. Chairman,
I would like to begin by mentioning how pleased the Mexican government feels about this panel
and I would like to welcome Ms. Pillay on behalf of Ambassador Gomez Camacho, the
Permanent Representative of Mexico, who was here this morning, but has had to go out

====================

I’d like to mention Mexico’s satisfaction with reference to Gareth Evans’ statement with regard to
the important way in which he identified those moments in which the responsibility to protect has
arisen and we thank him for the reference to the French-Mexican Initiative to have limits on the
use of the veto in cases of crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes. We believe, Sir,
that this is what the Initiative is about – the five Permanent Members of the Security Council, in
fact, bear a responsibility before the international community when they paralyze the United
Nations system and do not allow for intervention under the Charter. That is basically what the
Initiative is about and it is our wish that this responsibility, when it is vetoed, should be understood
in the reality of the international community by countries that bear the responsibility

====================

We are at a moment of restructuring of the pillar of international peace and security in the
organization and this is the right time to propose the question of prevention and also to underline,
as Professor Luck said – and we admire him in Mexico very much and he is held in high esteem
– the responsibility to protect afterwards. We believe that prevention is fine, but peace-building
should be comprised of two elements, which in this new architecture of international peace and
security, should be very present in the organization

====================

As we have seen, Sir, this is something, which is passionate. We believe that it is very important
and we congratulate the President of the General Assembly for organizing this debate. It is very
important for us to think dispassionately at the United Nations about this and that we see
prudently how we can strengthen the system and how we can pool our efforts in a positive way
for the organization

====================

For the moment, Sir, congratulations this Initiative and we recognize the commitment and the
work done by an excellent panel. Thank you

====================
