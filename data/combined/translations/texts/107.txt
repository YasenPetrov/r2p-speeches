On 6 September 2017, the UN General Assembly held an Informal Interactive Dialogue on the
Responsibility to Protect (R2P). The Interactive Dialogue addressed the UN Secretary-General's
ninth annual report on R2P, entitled " The Responsibility to Protect and Accountability for
Prevention’

====================

Following presentations by UN Secretary-General H.E. Mr. António Guterres and the
President of the General Assembly, H.E. Mr. Peter Thompson, a panel of experts delivered
remarks on the Secretary-General's report. The interactive dialogue was moderated by Special
Adviser on the Responsibility to protect, Mr. Ivan Simonovic. The Czech Republic in its
intervention supported the SG´s recommendation on the inclusion of the Responsibility to
protect on the formal agenda of the General Assembly and appreciated the efforts made by
the Special Advisers of the Secretary General on the Prevention of Genocide and
Responsibility to Protect

====================

We pointed out on practical implementation of the RtoP principle not only in ex-post but
better in ex-ante situations. We stressed the fact that coercive measures of Third Pillar of RtoP
are placed in hands of the Security Council puts high demands on the ability of its members
to act timely and decisively. In conclusion, we reaffirmed our commitment of the 2005 World
Summit Outcome Document, to the responsibility to protect population from crimes of
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, including prevention of
such crimes and once again expressed our full support to all efforts leading to its practical
operationalization
