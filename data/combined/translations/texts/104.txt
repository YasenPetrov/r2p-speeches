Statement delivered by DPRK – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2017
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]
Thank you, Mr. Moderator for giving me the floor

====================

I’d like to clarify the DPRK position on the report of the Secretary-General of the United
Nations on the Responsibility to Protect

====================

First, responsibility to protect its people from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and
crimes against humanity is entirely within each country’s sovereignty and it should be
respected. [Examples] of war continues across the world, many peoples in the world and
conflict-stricken countries were massacred and wander around as homeless refugees
seeking for means of life. But there has been no war for decades in the DPRK. People live a
peaceful and stable life. The DPRK government has stand firmly against the military threat
and aggression maneuvers of the hostile forces, which make desperate efforts to infringe
upon national sovereignty and people’s destiny

====================

Second, the concept of R2P was originated to legitimate unlawful foreign interference in
developing countries’ internal affairs and aggression under the clock of preventing and
protecting civilians. The concept [of] humanitarian intervention [by the] international
community in the past. The national sovereignty is a sacred and inviolable and a foundation
for the international relations. The R2P, which violates the national sovereignties, [only] to
justify the interference in internal affairs of the small and weak nations and dominations of
tens of them. It includes collective armed intervention as the last resort. When it is used
based on political motivation and double standards it is disastrous, as the reality shows us

====================

Therefore, the DPRK opposes the proposed inclusion of the doctrine R4P in the agenda of
the 72 session of the General Assembly
