At the outset, I would like to
thank the President for convening this formal debate. It
is my honour to speak on behalf of Hungary. While we
align ourselves with the statements delivered on behalf
of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect
(R2P) and the European Union (see A/73/PV.93), I wish
to make a few observations in my national capacity

====================

We welcome the Secretary-General’s latest report
(A/73/898) and the inclusion of R2P in this session’s
formal agenda. Hungary supports its inclusion as a
standing item on the Assembly’s agenda and the adoption
of a new resolution to reaffirm our commitment to
the principle

====================

Hungary shares the growing concerns of the
Secretary-General with regard to the negative
tendencies towards increasing numbers of victims
of atrocity crimes. We have to strengthen the United
Nations response by adopting specific measures to
improve the Organization’s internal coordination in the
area of R2P. That is why Hungary is strongly committed
to supporting the work of the Special Advisers on
the Prevention of Genocide and the Responsibility to
Protect. We welcome efforts to mainstream R2P within
the United Nations system, including through the
framework of analysis for atrocity crimes

====================

Hungary also deems it especially important that
States put more emphasis on prevention through various
measures, including early warning, political mediation,
empowering victims of crimes, enhancing domestic
and international capacities for ending impunity and

finding new ways to ensure more effective compliance
with international humanitarian law

====================

As an active member of the Group of Friends of
R2P, both in New York and in Geneva, Hungary is
fully committed to raising awareness of the issue at
the national and international levels. Hungary hosts
the Budapest Centre for the International Prevention
of Genocide and Mass Atrocities, which is dedicated
to assisting in building a global architecture for the
prevention of atrocity crimes, focuses its activities
on education and the dissemination of the culture
of dialogue. The Centre has joined the European
Union-funded Words are Stones campaign in order to
take an active part in combating hate speech occurring
online. The Centre will take the lead in organizing a
training course for young people involved in social
media to increase awareness of cyberbullying among
the youth in Hungary. Hungary is also committed to
strengthening the Global Network of R2P Focal Points
in order to draw greater attention to our R2P actions

====================

We encourage all actors to appoint their focal points
and join that very important community

====================

We are of the view that the existing human rights
mechanisms, together with the Human Rights Up Front
initiative, can effectively contribute to timely action

====================

Hungary strongly supports utilizing the prevention
mechanisms of the Human Rights Council and, as
a current member, one of our priorities is to work
towards the prevention of these atrocities by focusing
special attention on the protection and promotion of
human rights

====================

Finally yet importantly, Hungary has been organizing
the Budapest Human Rights Forum for 11 years now,
bringing together Government representatives and
civil society. Hungary also established a human rights
working group in 2012 with the purpose of monitoring
respect for human rights in Hungary

====================

We believe that actions should be taken at both
the national and international levels. We therefore
support the work of the International, Impartial and
Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation
and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most
Serious Crimes under International Law Committed
in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011 and the
International Criminal Court to end impunity and bring
perpetrators to justice. As an active member of the
Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group,
Hungary advocates voluntarily refraining from the use

of the veto in cases of mass atrocities, and encourages
all Member States that have not yet done so to sign the
code of conduct

====================

In conclusion, our ultimate goal should be to ensure
peaceful and secure living conditions for everyone
in their homelands without any possibility of being
victims of atrocity crimes. We share the opinion that
stronger political will is needed to make R2P a living
reality. We can assure the Assembly that our country
has that will and we will continue to encourage others
to implement the principle of R2P.
