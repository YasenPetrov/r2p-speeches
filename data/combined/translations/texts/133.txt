PRESS RELEASE
For immediate release
United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide expresses alarm at
public comments by Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte
(New York, 30 September 2016) The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide,
Adama Dieng, expressed alarm at public comments by President Rodrigo Duterte of the
Philippines, in which he reinforced a campaign to kill millions of drug addicts in the
Philippines and compared it to the massacre of millions of Jews by Hitler during the
Holocaust in Nazi Germany during World War II

====================

Adama Dieng qualified such a statement as deeply disrespectful of the right to life of all
human beings. He reminded that the Holocaust was one of the darkest periods of the
history of humankind and that any glorification of the cruel and criminal acts committed
by those responsible was unacceptable and offensive. He added that such statement was
also undermining the efforts of the international community to develop strategies to
prevent the recurrence of those crimes, to which all countries around the world should be
committed to

====================

The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide called upon President Rodrigo
Duterte to exercise restraint in the use of language that could exacerbate discrimination,
hostility and violence and encourage the commission of criminal acts which, if
widespread or systematic, could amount to crimes against humanity. He also requested
the President of the Philippines to support the investigation of the reported rise of killings
in the context of the anti-crime and anti-drug campaign targeting drug dealers and users
to ascertain the circumstances of each death
