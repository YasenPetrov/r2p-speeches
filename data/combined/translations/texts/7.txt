Joint Statement by the United Nations Special Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide and the
Responsibility to Protect and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and
Armed Conflict on Attacks Against Civilians in Central Mali
New York, 12 June 2019 – The three senior UN Official[i] condemn the unspeakable attack of 9 June
2019 against the village of Sobanou-Kou in the Mopti region of central Mali in which dozens of civilians
have been killed, the vast majority being women and children. They deplore the high number of civilian
casualties in Mopti region since the beginning of the year, including the 1 January attack against
Koulougon village that killed 39 civilians and the 23 March attack against Ogossagou village, in which at
least 157 civilians were killed. They call for immediate actions to deescalate tensions, particularly the
cycle of intercommunal and ethnic violence and retaliatory attacks that have been unfolding in central
Mali. They urge the Malian government to swiftly undertake a credible investigation into all the
atrocities committed in Mali and bring the perpetrators to justice

====================

“It is urgent to prevent further violence and brutality and to protect the civilian population from such
grave violations, especially women and children who are among the most vulnerable in times of
conflict,” they said. “Accountability is instrumental in the pursuit of peace and stability and the Malian
authorities, with the support of the international community, must step up to address the growing
insecurity in central Mali

====================

The details of this attack have yet to be clarified, but civilians caught in the spiral of violence have been
paying a heavy price since 2018, leading to the killing of hundreds of people since the beginning of the
year, increasingly framed along ethnic lines

====================

“As we recently stated in our statement on 27 March following the attack of Ogossagou Peulh village,
we are extremely alarmed by the ethnically motivated attacks against civilians in central in Mali as
demonstrated in this recent attack against the Dogon community,” the UN Officials stated. “We cannot
stand by silently in the face of ethnic-based violence, human rights violations and abuses. We call on the
authorities and all parties involved, including the international community, to fulfill their responsibility
to prevent atrocity crimes and protect civilians,” the Officials reiterated

====================

In addition, more than 800 schools remain closed in northern and central Mali, the delivery of
humanitarian assistance and protection to thousands of people in need has been hampered, making
communities even more vulnerable to instability and exposed to serious violations

====================

The UN Officials call on the Malian Government, with the support of the international community, to
discharge its primary responsibility to protect and address the root causes of violence and ensure that
vulnerable population, including boys and girls, are provided with the appropriate protection and
assistance. They further stressed that accountability for serious human rights violations, local

reconciliation and the full implementation of the peace agreement of 2015 are the only sustainable
ways to ensure lasting peace and protection of the civilian population
