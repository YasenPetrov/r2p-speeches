ADDRESS

Representative of the Russian Federation on an interactive discussion on
topic: "Implementation of our collective responsibility:
international assistance and the responsibility to protect "

September 8, 2014

Mr. Chairman,

Past rounds of online discussions allowed
exhaustively discuss the main aspects of the problems
the responsibility to protect. The practical usefulness of continuing
general theoretical debate on the merits of the concept is not obvious. AT
this regard, in his speech, we would like to focus
exclusively on the latest report of the Secretary-General
the problems of the responsibility to protect. This year it is dedicated
such important aspects as the international assistance
States to protect their populations from genocide, war
crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against

humanity. 2
Like all the previous reports, the documents in question

exclusively through the prism of the relevant section of the Outcome
2005 Summit document, which sets out only on
today recognized the scope of the concept
the responsibility to protect. In this context, is pleased to
notes that the current report of the Secretary-General confirms
the idea of ​​the exclusive and primary responsibility of
State to protect its own population from genocide,
war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity

====================

In general, the document contains practical-useful
oriented information, a generalized approach to the provision of
international assistance to States in fulfilling obligations
for the protection of its own population

====================

Upbeat on the attempt to formulate a report
a common set of principles for the provision of international assistance

====================

He is certainly not exhaustive, but includes
some important elements

====================

In particular, we fully agree that the key to success
any international assistance is the most complete account
national priorities and circumstances (Piopio] ozupeg $: p). each
the state is unique, and without full consideration of its political,
historical, legal, religious, cultural and other

features international assistance can bring more than 3

harm than good. Precedents are well known. they must
carefully study and analyze in order to not novtoryat
the previous mistakes. This approach will give real
content of other important principles of international
assistance, namely - "do no harm"

====================

We also support the thesis in the report about the special role
preventive measures in the implementation of the responsibility to protect and
inapplicability formulaic approaches to assist in
rule of law

====================

At the same time, we have to note that the report has not been
Places without causing issues. As in previous cases,
reports, we are concerned about attempts to introduce into circulation
the UN to refer to genocide, war crimes and
crimes against humanity, the general term "brutal
crimes "(so-called" amosyu sgitez "), which is not known
international law, and creates a lot of space for his freestyle
treatment

====================

From the findings in item 23 of the report difficult to accept: the relationship with
geographically distant countries can be characterized by
no less "historically caused tension" and
dominance of specific "political and economic
interests "than with neighboring states

====================

It is inappropriate, as we believe, and the excessive focus on the participation of

NGOs in the prevention of the most serious crimes of 4

international law. Well known cases where too
deep involvement of NGOs only exacerbate the situation in this or
other countries. Also drew attention to the expansion in the number of
cases of treatment of mandates UVKICH and HRC

====================

Separately want to stay at the mention of the report
strategy 'Rights - this is important "(" The prospect Noah). it
vnutrioonovskaya initiative. It has been developed without co-ordination
with Member States and without their participation. States have
very little information on the modalities and specific
the results of its implementation. In this regard, the positive evaluation given
Strategy in the report in the context of the responsibility to protect, gently
saying premature

====================

In general terms the document in question proves
namstivshuyusya recent trend in which
a progress report on the responsibility to protect gains
more academic. This is not surprising, because all
Aspects of the responsibility to protect over the years in the reports
Secretary General were covered. In this connection it is necessary to think again,
whether there is added value in the offer (n.80) include
the question of the responsibility to protect the official agenda
General Assembly. It is already so overloaded with technical issues,

academic and specialized character

====================

Thank you, Mr. President.
