Mr. Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide:
I would like to thank the President of the General Assembly be convened
this interactive dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect and the Secretary
General for his report. I also want to acknowledge their cooperation
permanent and welcome to Ms. Jennifer Walsh

====================

Mr. Moderator:
Since the Permanent Representative of Argentina participated as
panelist this morning, this intervention will touch briefly aspects
complementary

====================

The Final Document of the 2005 Summit reflects a commitment that
reality is not a new rule but a political concept that combines all
international obligations of States under the law
international human rights, international humanitarian law and
the right of refugees. Since its inception, Argentina supports the concept
the responsibility to protect

====================

Mr. Moderator:
Ambassador Perceval already referred to in the panel, the reaffirmation of the
primary responsibility of the state in my country due to severe
violations of human rights committed during the military dictatorship
between 1976-1983 and the national measures taken to investigate, prosecute and
punish the perpetrators, and to keep the memory necessary to ensure
non-repetition. These measures were complemented by actions in
international level, to which she referred

====================

Then let me mention the following:
In 2012, it launched, in collaboration with the Institute and with the support Auschwitz
Office of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of the
Genocide, the Latin American Network for the Prevention of Genocide and
Mass Atrocities. Network is already running collaboration
18 Latin American countries

====================

Moreover, the Regional Forums for the prevention of genocide are
undertaking that my country carries out with Switzerland and Tanzania since 2008

====================

Recently, he joined this initiative Cambodia

====================

two

Global Action against heinous crimes (Global Action Against Mass
Atrocity Crimes) has already been mentioned by other countries. Global Action was
launched this year under the auspices of Tanzania and Switzerland, and participated
also Argentina, Australia, Costa Rica and Denmark, as well as the Office
Joint Prevention of Genocide and the Responsibility to Protect and
NGOs. The goal is to serve as a network of international cooperation under which
networks prevention of genocide and responsibility to protect and
Existing can cooperate in preventing

====================

Mr. Moderator:
A crucial element for prevention is that States accept the
obligations under treaties for the protection of
human rights, humanitarian law and refugee law, and
that integrate their internal policies. I would also like to highlight the
importance of ratifying the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
International, since the contribution of the ICC to combat impunity
it's undeniable

====================

Argentina agrees that as a challenge prevention
atrocities be incorporated into national policies on rights
humans, it is important to get the United Nations more work
integrated with, for example, levels of the Secretariat, the Council
Human rights and the mechanisms of rapporteurs and experts
independent, treaty bodies and the Human Rights
Commissions of Inquiry

====================

Mr. Moderator:
We believe it is important at this point to recall that since the beginning of the
concept of responsibility to protect, were coercive measures,
particularly the use of force, which, although conceived as last ratio-generated
discomfort and mistrust

====================

That distrust increased after armed action authorized by the
Libya Security Council and the Secretary-General himself recognizes
concerns raised in its report of 2012

====================

The action of the United Nations can not follow foreign policy objectives
the organization or cause more casualties among civilians sought
protect, because that would affect the credibility of the concept of responsibility

protect and, ultimately, the legitimacy of collective action of Nations
together

====================

Today, several delegations referred to the situation in Syria and
heard some speeches exhorting armed action

====================

Argentina condemns the use of chemical weapons with the same forcefulness
condemning all other serious violations of human rights,
wherever they occur, whatever the cause and whoever wielded
it is responsible, and firmly believes in the need for accountability
accountable for such crimes. Research supports the Secretary-General
on the possible use of chemical weapons in Syria, and expected results
objective and impartial

====================

Argentina, since joining the Security Council, and finding a
crisis took two years, always he maintained the need for a
political solution. airstrikes will cause only, as in Libya, more
deaths and also an armed action without authorization from the Council
Security would be simply an action in violation of the Charter of the United Nations
together

====================

Mr. Moderator:
Argentina believes that the avoidance Pillar III, which concerns both
many countries, is to deepen the efforts and cooperation
prevention. We support the recommendations of the Report of the Secretary
General and in particular the proposal to address now Pillar II

====================

Finally, I would like to thank once again the Joint Office for its
Cooperative work with Member States

====================

Thank you

Mr. Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide,
I would like to thank the President of the General Assembly for having
convened this interactive dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect (RtoP),
and the Secretary General for his Report. Also, I would like to recognize your
constant cooperation and welcome Mrs. Jennifer Walsh

====================

Mr. Moderator,
As the Permanent Representative of Argentina intervened as a panelist this
morning, this statement will briefly touch upon some complementary aspects

====================

The Final Outcome of the 2005 Summit embodies a commitment that
constitutes no new norm, but is a political concept summarizing all
international obligations of States under international human rights law,
international humanitarian law and refugee law. Since the beginning,
Argentina supports the concept of RtoP

====================

Mr. Moderator,
Ambassador Perceval, at the panel, made reference to the reaffirmation of the
primary responsibility of the State that took place in Argentina due to the
serious violations of human rights committed during the military dictatorship
between 1976-83 and to the national measures adopted to investigate,
prosecute and punish those responsible, and to maintain memory of those
events, something necessary to ensure non recurrence. Those measures were
complemented with actions in the international arena, to which she referred

====================

I would then like to touch upon the following aspects:
The Latin-American Network for the Prevention of Genocide and Mass
Atrocities was launched in 2012 with the cooperation of the Auschwitz
Institute and with the support of the Office of the Special Advisor for the
Prevention of Genocide. The Network is already functioning, with the
collaboration of 18 Latin-American countries

====================

Also, the Regional Fora for the Prevention of Genocide are an undertaking
initiated in 2008 together with Switzerland and Tanzania. Recently, Cambodia
joined this initiative

====================

The Global Action against Mass Atrocity Crimes has been mentioned by
other countries. The Global Action was launched this year under the auspices
5

of Tanzania and Switzerland, and Argentina participated together with
Australia, Costa Rica and Denmark, as well as the Joint Office for the
Prevention of Genocide and RtoP and NGOs. The purpose is to have a
network of international cooperation under which existing networks on the
prevention of genocide and RtoP could channel cooperation on prevention

====================

Mr. Moderator,
A crucial element of prevention is the acceptance by States of the obligations
arising from instruments on the protection of human rights, on humanitarian
law and on refugee law. Also, I would like to underscore the importance of
ratifying the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court, as the
contribution of the ICC to the fight against impunity is undeniable

====================

Argentina coincides in the challenge it is to incorporate prevention of
atrocities into national human rights policies, but at the same time it is
important to achieve more integration at the UN with, for example, other
parts of the Secretariat, the Human Rights Council and the rapporteurs and
independent experts mechanisms, human rights treaties organs and factfinding commissions

====================

Mr. Moderator,
We believe it is important now to remember that since the inception of the
RtoP concept, coercive measures â€“in particular the use of force- were those
that, even when conceived as ultima ratio, generated discomfort and distrust

====================

That distrust was increased by the armed action authorized by the Security
Council with respect to Libya, and the Secretary General himself recognized
the concerns raised in his 2012 Report

====================

Action by the United Nations cannot either pursue political objectives alien to
the Organization, or cause more victims among the civilians seeking to
protect, as it would affect the credibility of the RtoP concept and, in the end,
the legitimacy of collective action by the UN

====================

Today, several delegations made reference to the situation in Syria, and we
heard some interventions calling for armed action

====================

Argentina condemns the use of chemical weapons as firmly at it condemns all
other serious violations of human rights, occurring anywhere in the world,
under any excuse, and whomever is responsible, and firmly believes in the
6

need to hold those responsible to account. Argentina supports the
investigation by the Secretary General on the possible use of chemical
weapons in Syria, and awaits its objective and impartial results

====================

Argentina, since it joined the Security Council and having found a crisis that
had endured for two years, has always sustained the need to achieve a political
solution. Aerial attacks would only cause, as in Libya, more deaths. Also, an
armed action without Security Council authorization would be, simply, a
violation of the UN Charter

====================

Mr. Moderator,
Argentina believes that the way to avoid Pillar III â€“which raised the concern
of many countries- is to strengthen our efforts and cooperation on
prevention. We support the recommendations of the Report of the Secretary
General, in particular his proposal to address Pillar II next

====================

Finally, I would like to thank once more the Joint Office for its cooperative
work with Member States

====================

Thank you
