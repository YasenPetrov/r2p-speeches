Statement made by the Permanent Representative of Chile, Ambassador Heraldo Mufioz, on
occasion of the debate of the General Assembly on Responsibility to Protect

Mr. President,
Thank you for convening this meeting. I will refer to some key aspects of the Secretary
General's report titled "Implementing the Responsibility to Protect" which we welcome

====================

As a previous point, regarding the surprising references to ideological characters known for
their animosity towards the UN in order to question the legal value of the Outcome Document
of the 2005 World Summit, I, instead, prefer to cite distinguished jurist Ian Brownlie who in
his volume Principles of Public International Law (4thedition) indicates that "The Final Act or
other statement of conclusions of a conference of states can be a form of multilateral treaty"
and, in any case, can be considered a source of international law. Moreover, the practice of
political organs such as the GA, whose resolutions are not binding, have - according to
Brownlie - "considerable legal meaning". It should be recalled that the Summit Outcome
Document was adopted by the GA resolution A/RES/30/1

====================

Surely, this is not a legal-academic discussion, but a political debate, with moral connotations,
about the practical and consensual implementation of the RtoP concept. My delegation
expresses, in the context of the divergent positions existing within the members of NAM, our
firm commitment to RtoP, whose solid foundations were established by the Heads of State and
Government in paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 Outcome Document and which cannot be
selectively addressed or revised

====================

Mr. President
The Secretary General's report contributes significantly to turning RtoP into an operational
concept

====================

The report fine-tunes the discussion on the concept in such a way that it can be summarized in
one single phrase: tlzree pillars ant1 four crimes. The pillars are, first, the primacy of State
responsibility; second, international assistance; and, third, a timely and decisive response. At
the same time, the only four crimes comprised in RtoP are: genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing, and crimes against humanity, as well as the incitement of these crimes. In short, not
any humanitarian tragedy or human rights violations should activate the RtoP

====================

The discussion of RtoP has been plagued by misperceptions and myths. There are those who
visualize the concept limiting it to just one pillar (actually half of a pillar): that dealing with
action through the UN Security Council under chapter VII

====================

But, above all, RtoP is a call addressed to States to deal with serious human rights issues "jrom
within ", and this apparently has not been fully understood. This is the first pillar of RtoP. The
Responsibility to Protect refers essentially to the State, which has the duty to protect its
populations, whether nationals or not

====================

The modem state assumed explicit responsibilities to protect its populations in the Geneva
Conventions, dating back to 1864, in the UN Charter, and in the UN Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, as well as in the various conventions dealing with the crime of genocide, forced

disappearances, torture and others. In short, the state's responsibility to protect rests on
long-standing obligations under international law. This is the adequate interpretation of
Article 2.7 of the Charter,which led the UN to action, not without delay, against South Africa
and its regime of apartheid

====================

The State itself has the power to set in motion most of the components of RtoP. The State
should be alert to the first signs of bigotry, intolerance and human rights violations that could
lead to genocide or any of the other three major crimes involved in RtoP. Only if the State is
unable to cope with a humanitarian crisis, should the second pillar be made effective; in other
words, the assistance of the international community to help States fulfill their Responsibility
to Protect. Or rather assist those States before conflicts break out, thus playing "at best a
complementary role" as the SG7s report states. A preventive approach could include
international mediation or good offices, as well as initiatives to promote reconciliation

====================

The third pillar of RtoP is the timely and decisive response by the international community

====================

Evidently, the world leaders in the Summit Outcome were not thinking only about the use of
force --which should always be considered a measure of last resort. Paragraph 139 in this
regard is forceful but cautious

====================

Paragraph 139 refers to peaceful measures that could be undertaken following chapters VI and
VIII of the Charter. For example, under article 34 of the Charter, the Security Council could
just send a mission to investigate "any situation which might lead to international friction," as
in mass atrocities that have provoked tensions with neighbors, trans-boundary violence, forced
migrations, etc

====================

Non-peaceful collective action requires at least two operational conditions, namely the
determination to take collective action on a case-by-case basis and only "should peaceful
means be inadequate and national authorities are manifestly failing to protect their
populations from genocide.. ." In such scenario, Member States "are prepared to take collective
action, in a timely and decisive manner, through the Security Council, in accordance with the
Charter, including Chapter V11.. 

====================

It is clear that the collective obligation is not to intervene, but rather to adopt whatever
"timely and decisive" actions the international community deems appropriate, in
accordance with the UN Charter. There is no automaticity, triggers, or implicit green lights
for coercive action in what the world leaders agreed

====================

Regional organizations should play a larger role with regard to the third pillar of the
Responsibility to Protect. In the Outcome Document regional organizations were given a role
of cooperation with the UN. Because of geographical proximity, they are better placed to learn
first about serious human rights violations. This is why, probably, in 2000 the Constitutive Act
of the African Union, in Article 4 (b), declared "the right of the Union to intervene in a
Member state pursuant to a decision of the Assembly in respect to grave circumstances,
namely: war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity

====================

The GA was entrusted by world leaders with the task of continuing consideration of RtoP and
its implications. One such consideration could be the development of the second pillar; that
is, to discuss a strategy or plan of action for tlze preventiort of the four crimes, through
cooperation with countries that so request it

====================

The establishment of an "early warning capability" would have to be a relevant component of
the prevention policy. As the Secretary General's report states, "information itself is rarely the
missing ingredient" regatding the impending occurrence of genocide and the other three
crimes. The point is how that information can be improved, quality-wise, and how it can be
shared and assessed by the relevant institutions. More coherence is needed in the sharing of
information already available in the UN system so that the competent bodies can adopt timely
decisions. We agree that a first step towards an "early warning capability" is the Secretary
General's suggestion of the convergence of the work of his Special Adviser on the
Responsibility to Protect with that of his the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide

====================

A strategy for preventing the occurrence of the RtoP crimes could contemplate democracy
promotion. Democracies, in spite of their imperfections, generally do not go to war against
each other and usually they do not commit atrocities such as the four crimes. Consequently,
mechanisms such as the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF), the Rule of Law
Coordination and Resource Group and UNDP's democratic governance program, should be
strengthened to lend democratic governance support to those countries that so request it

====================

Mr. President
For nearly 200 years, Latin American countries suffered "Pax Americana", with preventive
military operations and regime changes. So, the principle of non-intervention became crucial
for Latin Americans and other developing nations; but in ways that would respect others
principles of the UN Charter and regional organizations charters, including the respect for
human rights and universal morality. During the cold war, many countries in Latin America,
including my own, suffered dictatorial repression with crimes against humanity. The Nixon
administration actively contributed to the tragedy in my country while others, both from the
North and the South, kept silent

====================

During the 80s, dictatorships began making way to restored democracies. The legacy of
extrajudicial killings, disappearances of political prisoners and torture still haunts Latin
American societies with its consequences. Our countries felt caught between a rock and a hard
place. Most Latin American leaders wished to explore a better alternative to the stark choice
between inaction vs. unilateral external intervention in case of a humanitarian crisis. For
them, it was necessary to reconcile the morality of legitinzacy with international legality. RtoP
is the balanced formula we were looking for, and prevention the best way to save lives and to
allocate scarce resources to peacebuilding or the fight against poverty

====================

We are aware that any altruistic concept may be abused by the powerful to apply it in line with
their national interests to legitimize interventions that have little or nothing to do with - in this
case -the four major crimes. However, misuse of a concept does not invalidate it

====================

Selective application of RtoP is evidently a risk; yet no principle has withstood the test of
perfect application and, in any event, principles lose credibility precisely when they are applied
in a partisan way. We are also aware that any permanent member of the Security Council could
veto a resolution proposing coercive action aimed at safeguarding local populations from the
four mass atrocities (there is always the possibility, in case the Security Council wouldn't
exercise its main responsibility of maintaining peace and security, of convening the General
Assembly following its 377 "United for Peace"). Anyway, it would be morally and politically
wrong to conclude that because the international community cannot act everywhere it,
therefore, should act nowhere

====================

Finally, it is necessary to reinsert the moral component into our discussion. International
inaction is not acceptable ~s in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 or Srebrenica in 1995. But this
is not an issue that solely concerns countries that have suffered humanitarian tragedies

====================

That would be limiting the problem to a subcategory of countries. The challenge of
humanitarian protection is a global one. Raising our voices in the event of such crimes
helps; but it is the bare minimum required. The international community must move from
words to action, in the sensible and prudent way stated in the Secretary General's report,
reconciling, as I have said, the morality of legitimacy with international legality
