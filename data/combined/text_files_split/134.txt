Statement by the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect in
Geneva at the HRC 33 General Debate Item 10 – Technical assistance and
capacity-building

Mr. President,
I have the honour of delivering this statement on behalf of the Group of
Friends of the Responsibility to Protect1

====================

Widespread and systematic abuses or violations of human rights often
serve as early warning signs of potential genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and/or crimes against humanity. As the High Commissioner
recently stressed, “Failure to prevent human rights violations weighs
unbearably on victims, and is profoundly destabilizing for States”

====================

The responsibility of states to take action to prevent atrocity crimes,
consistent with international law, is well established. The toolbox for such
action is wide-ranging and includes encouragement and assistance by the
Human Rights Council

====================

That is why today we wish to stress the key role of the Human Rights
Council to support technical assistance and capacity-building work in the
prevention of atrocity crimes. The prevention of atrocity crimes requires,
inter alia but not limited to, “sustained efforts to build the resilience of
societies (…) by ensuring that the rule of law is respected and that all
human rights are protected, without discrimination; by establishing
legitimate and accountable national institutions; by eliminating
corruption; by managing diversity, constructively; and by supporting a
strong and diverse civil society and a pluralistic media2”

====================

Putting an end to serious violations of human rights and atrocity crimes
should be seen as the beginning of a period of social renewal and
institutional capacity-building, aimed at making future re-lapse into

Analysis Framework

violence less likely. The second pillar of the Responsibility to Protect
highlights that “The international community has a responsibility to
encourage and assist States in fulfilling this responsibility”

====================

In this regard, the importance of capacity-building, early warning, and
accountable and inclusive national institutions cannot be overlooked. We
wish to underline the importance of technical cooperation, aimed at
assisting States, upon their request, in building and strengthening national
capacities that have a direct impact on the observance and enjoyment of
human rights

====================

In this respect, we commend the Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights for the early and flexible responses tailored to specific
situations in the context of its capacity building and technical assistance
work. The activities undertaken through its field presences can contribute
to assisting States to take appropriate legislative, administrative and other
measures, to prevent human rights violations and their potential
escalation into atrocity crimes or conflict. These activities can contribute
to creating enabling environments for strong domestic systems of
promotion and protection of human rights

====================

The integration of a human rights perspective into the work of United
Nations Country Teams and United Nations peacekeeping missions is
another positive development that can contribute to the prevention of
gross violations of human rights that can potentially lead to atrocity
crimes

====================

Today, more work is required to increase the support which can be
provided on the ground. We urge the Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights to strengthen its preventative capacity, including through
further elaboration of its prevention toolkit and we encourage states to
fully cooperate with the Council, the Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights, and Special Procedure mandate holders

====================

I thank you

====================
