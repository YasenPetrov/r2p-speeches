We welcome the
inclusion of the responsibility to protect and the
prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity on the formal agenda of
the General Assembly at its seventy-second session

====================

At a time when the atrocities committed in various
corners of the world continue to cause unprecedented
human suffering, the international community must
address the issue of preventing such crimes. We thank
the Secretary-General for his comprehensive annual
report (A/72/884), which constitutes a solid basis for
our deliberations today

====================

At the 2005 World Summit, Member States
made a landmark commitment with regard to their
responsibility to protect populations from genocide,
war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity. Unfortunately, the report of the Secretary-

General portrays a daunting picture concerning the
negative trends in that regard. Since 2005, deaths
caused by armed conflicts have increased tenfold and
the number of people forcibly displaced has reached
record levels. It is clear that civilians are the ones who
pay the highest price when Member States fail to uphold
their responsibility to protect. As we speak, millions of
innocent people who have had to flee their homes owing
to the atrocities committed in Syria, Myanmar and
elsewhere are seeking to survive in desperate situations

====================

In order to prevent and alleviate that immense human
suffering, the international community must consider
efficient ways and means to narrow the gap between its
commitments and actions

====================

The responsibility to protect has not yet become an
established norm of international law, and its scope and
implementation should be defined and refined. Efforts
in that regard should not be carried out in a way that
reinterprets or renegotiates well-established principles
of international law or the existing legal framework

====================

Crimes of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity are well-defined legal
concepts. We should implement the relevant legal
framework faithfully and consistently. We should also
bear in mind that the concept of the responsibility to
protect seeks to establish a delicate balance between
safeguarding the humanitarian concerns of the
international community while respecting the principle
of national sovereignty. Pursuing a non-selective
approach vis-à-vis the implementation of that concept
is key if we are to achieve the widest possible consensus
among the membership on that important issue

====================

Discussions such as the ones we are having today can
contribute to progress in that regard

====================

We welcome the Secretary-General’s approach,
which has a central focus on prevention. Indeed,
prevention is one of the most effective instruments in
our toolbox. Turkey believes that preventive policies and
mediation efforts should have a more prominent role

====================

With that understanding. Turkey attaches particular
importance to preventive diplomacy and is pioneering
mediation efforts not only in the United Nations but
also through regional and bilateral initiatives in our
wider geographical area and working actively for the
peaceful settlement of disputes. When efforts aimed
at prevention do not succeed, United Nations organs,
including the Security Council, must remain ready to
assume their responsibilities as enshrined in the Charter
of the United Nations. We hope that the discussions on

the responsibility to protect and its implementation will
also contribute to the efforts aimed at restraining the
use of the veto power in the Security Council where
crimes against humanity and the crime of genocide
are concerned

====================

Before concluding, I would like to underscore
that ensuring accountability for crimes that have been
committed should also be an indispensable component
of our discussion today. Accountability is essential not
only to avoiding impunity and delivering justice but
also to preventing the recurrence of atrocities in future.
