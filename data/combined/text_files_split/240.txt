Statement delivered by the Delegation of Syria to the United Nations, at the United
Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion "From commitment to
implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened by the President
of the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
25 February 2016
Syria would like to say that we are also commemorating the 5th year since the military
intervention in Libya. It would be logical that the UN adopt criteria so as to avoid abusive use
of the concept of Responsibility to Protect. Mr. Evans knows well that criteria were established
so as to use this concept. Now, why have we not heard of these criteria since then?
The Deputy SG spoke of the reputation of the UN and the fact that it was tarnished, but is this
not the responsibility of the countries that abused the idea of Responsibility to Protect. This
has also undermined international justice and the concept of the impunity of these countries

====================

You referred to the efforts we must make so as to fully define these concepts but these efforts
will be useless unless with strengthen the responsibilities of countries themselves in
Responsibility to Protect

====================

The UN should play a role in accordance with its Charter if we truly want to pursue consensus
amongst members States on this subject. The UN must be honest, must prove their honesty,
they must abstain from any politicization or selectivity any sort of dual standards. The UN must
also ensure that it does not lose the trust of countries. The silence of the UN on the Israeli
occupation crimes clearly show the policy of dual standards in this organization

====================

The idea of the Responsibility to Protect is a noble idea, its goal is to save lives, not to spread
chaos and destruction, as was the case in Libya. It is also not a tool that would allow illegal
interventions or a new means for a new colonization

====================

We also wish to say that we are in favor of the Russian and American initiative to cease
hostilities in Syria. We call on the UN force countries who are looking to increase the conflict
to immediately end their actions

====================
