Vice-President, took the Chair

====================

Ghana is deeply appreciative of its continued
partnership with like-minded countries — Australia,
Italy, Qatar, Denmark, Rwanda, France, Costa Rica
and Finland, to name a few — in promoting national
and regional ownership and implementation of the
responsibility to protect. We commend the Joint Office
of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide
and on the Responsibility to Protect, the Global Centre
for the Responsibility to Protect and the International
Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect for their
support and active engagement with Member States and
regional organizations, and call for their cooperation in
the development of options to enhance early warning
and early action

====================

Ghana attaches great importance to collaboration
with civil society as strategic partners in the
implementation of the responsibility to protect. In our

national experience, non-partisan support in favour of
civil-society organization initiatives by various political
parties and our Parliament helped in the creation of
Ghana’s National Peace Council as an independent
State institution of mediation and peace facilitation

====================

The National Peace Council today is an important part
of Ghana’s governance and peace architecture, as well
as a key component of relevant strategic partnerships
forged with bilateral, regional and global institutions

====================

The complementarity of the different pillars
of governance and peace infrastructure and their
interactive nature came into play during the Supreme
Court hearing on Ghana’s presidential election petition
in 2012. The hearing and its outcome demonstrated
the role of the judiciary, as an important pillar of
governance and peace, in promoting the rule of law
and safeguarding electoral integrity. Other national
institutions that played a critical role in the process
included the independent Electoral Commission; the
Inter-Party Advisory Committee; the executive, through
its National Security Council; traditional authorities;
the National Peace Council; the National Commission
for Civic Education and faith-based institutions

====================

Clearly, building capacity for good governance
and peace should encompass all institutions in the
business of development and institutions in the area of
constitution-building, the rule of law and accountability
oversight, as well as independent watchdog and
advocacy agencies. We want to stress that building
prevention capacities at the community and national
levels must be prioritized, together with the effective
mobilization of the requisite resources for the effective
implementation of the responsibility to protect

====================

In closing, my delegation calls on Member States to
declare their support for the responsibility to protect and
to enable all views to be considered in the preparation
of the report and outcome of this debate. Finally, the
combined effect of the responsibility to protect, the
responsibility while protecting and the responsibility to
remember should help us make progress in preventing
and ending genocide, war crimes and crimes against
humanity, and in building resilience.
