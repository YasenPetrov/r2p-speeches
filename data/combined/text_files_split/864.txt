At the outset, I would
like to thank the Secretary-General and the President
of the General Assembly for convening and supporting
this crucial formal debate, which offers an excellent
opportunity to renew and enhance our pledge to build
a stronger global partnership for the prevention of
genocide. We want to thank Australia and Ghana for
having pushed so hard to put it on the agenda here in
the General Assembly

====================


We share the growing concerns of the SecretaryGeneral about the increase in the number of victims
of atrocity crimes. That is why we have to strengthen
the response of the United Nations by implementing
specific measures to improve internal United Nations
coordination in the area of the responsibility to protect

====================

Hungary strongly supports the work of the Special
Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and the
Secretary-Generalâ€™s decision to appoint a new Special
Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect. It is more
important than ever to ensure that States place more
emphasis on prevention through various measures,
including early-warning systems, political mediation,
empowering the victims of crimes, enhancing domestic
and international capacities for ending impunity and
finding new ways to ensure more effective compliance
with international humanitarian law

====================

As an active member of the Group of Friends of the
Responsibility to Protect, Hungary is fully dedicated
to raising awareness on the issue at the national and
international levels. We support the work of the
Budapest Centre for the International Prevention of
Genocide and Mass Atrocities, which among other
things will host a workshop on the prevention of
radicalization in practice, aimed at raising awareness in
the security sector in Hungary on the challenges posed
by polarization and radicalization

====================

In order to enhance the visibility of international
human rights mechanisms and to provide a platform for
international dialogue on current human rights issues,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary
has organized the annual Budapest Human Rights
Forum for 10 years now, bringing together national
and international human rights experts as well as
representatives of non-governmental and governmental
organizations and academia

====================

In the field of crime prevention, for example, we
adopted a national crime prevention strategy for the
period from 2013 to 2023. We provide various training
programmes for professionals working with young
people, including mediation training to handle conflict
in schools. With regard to human rights, in 2012 the
Government established a human rights working group
with the purpose of monitoring respect for human rights
in Hungary in compliance with the recommendations of
the Human Rights Council and the Working Group on
the Universal Periodic Review

====================


We believe, of course, that action should be taken
not only at the national but also the international level

====================

We therefore support the work of the International,
Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the
Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible
for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law
Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March
2011. Hungary has always been an active member of the
Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT)
group, supporting efforts to make the Security Council
more efficient, inclusive and legitimate. We advocate
for refraining voluntarily from the use of the veto in
case of mass atrocities, and we encourage all member
States that have not yet done so to sign the code of
conduct formulated by the ACT group to strengthen
cooperation within the United Nations framework

====================

The role of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is
also vital to ending impunity and bringing perpetrators
to justice when national criminal accountability
mechanisms are not available. That is why we stand by
the ICC and have pledged our full support to the values
it defends

====================

Our eventual goal, of course, should be to ensure
peaceful and secure living conditions for all in their
homelands, free from the possibility of falling victim
to atrocity crimes. However, this can be achieved only
by tackling the root causes of conflict, as well as by
dealing with transnational threats such as violent
extremism, terrorism, human trafficking, modern-day
slavery, climate change and water scarcity as part of
our broader prevention efforts.
