(spoke in
Spanish): I have the honour to speak on behalf of
France and my own country, Mexico, in our capacity
as promoters of the French-Mexican initiative on the
suspension of the veto in cases of mass atrocities

====================

States have the primary responsibility to protect
their peoples. Protecting the population from genocide,
war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity is not a matter of political will, but an
obligation under international law. We welcome the
report of the Secretary-General (A/73/898), which
reaffirms the relevance of this agenda for his broader
strategy that prioritizes prevention throughout the
United Nations system

====================

Whereas mass atrocities appear in news headlines,
prevention does not. We warmly welcome the
appointment of Ms. Karen Smith as Special Adviser to
the Secretary-General on the Responsibility to Protect,
as well as the appointment of Mr. Adama Dieng, Special
Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of
Genocide, as the focal point for the implementation
of the United Nations strategy and plan of action on
hate speech

====================

Effective prevention includes a set of tools
that interact in specific contexts. We must develop
a comprehensive and coherent alignment among
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
promoting peacekeeping operations and the Action
for Peacekeeping initiative, protecting civilians and
promoting sustainable peace and human rights. Without
labelling them as preventive measures, States already
implement programmes and policies that address the
root causes of conflict and, as a result, atrocity crimes
are prevented. Reducing inequalities, combating

discrimination and promoting inclusive institutions
play an important role in ensuring that our societies
never have to face serious violations

====================

We must also support regional initiatives to
prevent atrocity crimes, including the strengthening
of partnerships with regional and subregional
organizations. In that regard, the partnership among the
United Nations, the African Union and the European
Union, as well as links with subregional organizations,
such as the Economic Community of West African
States and the Latin American Network for Genocide
and Mass Atrocity Prevention, should be enhanced,
thereby promoting the exchange of good practices

====================

In the face of sharp challenges to multilateralism,
we must intensify our efforts to ensure that the United
Nations fulfils its purposes. It is insufficient to receive
early warnings of imminent crises if they are not
translated into responses

====================

Our responses to extreme human suffering have
been far from adequate. That is why, in 2014, our
Governments presented the Franco-Mexican initiative
to suspend the use of the veto in the Security Council
as a concrete way to operationalize the responsibility
to protect (R2P). We are convinced that the veto is
not a privilege but an international responsibility. Our
initiative seeks a voluntary and collective commitment
by the five permanent members of the Council not
to use the veto in cases of genocide, crimes against
humanity and war crimes in order to enable the
Security Council to take effective action. At the
moment, the initiative is already supported by 101
States. We take this opportunity to urge all States that
have not yet done so, particularly the other permanent
members of the Security Council, to join the initiative

====================

In the face of mass atrocities, political agendas are
simply unjustifiable

====================

France and Mexico firmly believe that we should
make better use of existing mechanisms and institutions,
such as the Universal Periodic Review, to strengthen our
national preventive tools. The Human Rights Council
must work hand in hand with the Security Council
to transmit early warnings, enable timely action and
empower the peacebuilding architecture

====================

For some, R2P has become synonymous with
vigorous disagreements. To overcome them, it is fitting
that we hold an open discussion in the same General
Assembly, which gave rise to the concept. Another
opportunity to continue the discussions will arise at the

Legal Advisers meeting to take place during the Sixth
Committee’s International Law Week. Our priority
should be to operationalize the political commitments
that underpin the responsibility to protect. An open
dialogue such as this is an opportunity that should be
seized by all Member States

====================

Non-intervention does not mean indifference, and
neither is it a blank cheque for impunity. No amount
of Security Council action can replace the inherent
obligation of States to protect their populations. Our two
countries speak with one voice in this debate because we
are committed to a rules-based international order that
promotes stability and human rights. The loss of human
life is too high a cost to pay for a lack of consensus

====================

This is at the heart of our joint initiative — that full
respect for the Charter of the United Nations and full
respect for human life cannot be mutually exclusive

====================

(Cyprus),

Vice-President,

To avoid the repetition of mass atrocities, we must
ensure accountability for perpetrators of crimes and
justice for the victims. We continue to urge all States to
support and cooperate with missions and commissions
of inquiry dealing with mass atrocity crimes, as well as
with instruments of international criminal justice. In
that regard, we reiterate our call for all States to accede
to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
and to cooperate with the Court. The international
community must continue to prevent and combat sexual
and gender-based violence as a tactic of war

====================

We deliver this joint Mexican-French statement
today as an example of the cooperation that can exist
between permanent members of the Security Council
and all other Member States that recognize the value of
our common institutions. No responsibility is above the
responsibility to protect the peoples of our world. We
owe it to ourselves, our peoples and our United Nations
to live up to our responsibilities.
