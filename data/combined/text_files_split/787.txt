The European Union is
pleased to introduce draft resolution A/73/L.94, entitled
“Towards torture-free trade: examining the feasibility,
scope and parameters for possible common international
standards”, on behalf of the 66 members of the Global
Alliance for Torture-Free Trade and numerous other
States that are committed to seeing the international
community take collective steps forward on this issue

====================

All States are welcome to join the Alliance

====================

This is a timely moment for such an initiative,
falling two days after the international community
marked the International Day in Support of Victims of
Torture to honour victims and survivors throughout the
world. Today we have an opportunity to turn our words
into action

====================

The reason why so many States have come together
to call for greater scrutiny of this trade is simple. It is
unconscionable to turn a blind eye to the import and
export of goods that can be used to inflict torture,
suffering and even death. Permit me to cite some
examples: the spiked baton, which is a truncheon
with sharp metal spikes along part or all of its shaft;
the electric-shock belt equipped to deliver extremely
painful electric shocks, which is fixed around the
victim’s body; and the portable gas chamber, which
requires no further explanation

====================

The international community is united in its
condemnation of torture and has on many occasions
underscored the imperative of working towards
its eradication. Put simply, torture is illegal under
international law. Some 166 States have ratified
the United Nations Convention against Torture and
have thereby pledged to take effective legislative,
administrative, judicial and other measures to prevent
acts of torture in their territory. Taking steps to address
the trade in torture goods is a critical way in which such
prevention can be assured

====================

The trade in goods that can only be used for torture
and other cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment or
punishment has been a long-standing concern at the
United Nations. Indeed, over 30 years ago, the first
Special Rapporteur on Torture, who was appointed
by the Commission on Human Rights, addressed
the issue in an early report. Subsequent Rapporteurs
have scrutinized the torture trade in more detail and
underscored the importance of controlling that trade
in order to deliver on the international community’s
commitment to eradicating torture. Several resolutions

have called for action in this field — most recently
resolution 72/163, on torture, which was adopted
by consensus on 17 December 2017. Regional
organizations, such as the African Union Commission
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe have recognized the seriousness of the torture
trade and recommended action

====================

In bringing forward the draft resolution under
consideration today, we have taken care to ensure
a careful step-by-step approach that avoids making
snap judgements as to how the torture trade should
be addressed. Our proposed approach is intended
first and foremost to solicit the views of all States
Members of the United Nations as to how common
international standards might be formulated in future

====================

The views of all Member States will form the basis
for the Secretary-General’s report that will then be
taken up for consideration by a group of governmental
experts chosen on the basis of equitable geographical
distribution. That group of experts will be charged with
reporting to the seventy-fifth session of the General
Assembly. This process is designed to deliver food for
thought in an efficient and transparent manner and to
support an open and constructive engagement among
the States Members of the United Nations. It does not
prejudge what further steps might then be taken by the
international community. It does not lock in further
action in New York or Geneva

====================

We have also sought to ensure that the negotiation
process was fair and transparent. We have held three
informal consultative meetings to garner views and
made a range of changes to the text. The text now
makes a crystal-clear demarcation between goods used
for torture and those used for the death penalty and
does not entail judgments on the death penalty. The
draft does provide that instruments used to apply the
death penalty are to be included within the purview of
the Secretary-General’s report, because certain goods
that are traded, including portable gas chambers, can
be used in ways that inflict undue suffering

====================

We have heard concerns from some States during
the informal consultations that the draft resolution
conflates trade and human rights concerns in an
inappropriate way — and even that we have been
motivated by protectionist instincts. We would like
to reassure those who made these points. First, the
members of the Global Alliance have a proven record
in advancing free trade and are core supporters of a
multilateral trading system. A commitment to free trade

does not mean that we should tolerate the import and
export of goods that have been specifically designed
to maim and kill. Secondly, it is by no means unusual
for the United Nations to deliberate on issues that bring
together trade and human rights considerations. The
Kimberley Process governing blood diamonds and the
United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights are just two examples. The text makes it
clear that the initiative does not aim at creating barriers
to international trade

====================

We do not claim that the draft resolution before the
General Assembly today has all the answers. Torture
can of course be inflicted with a fist or a pencil. But we
do contend that turning a blind eye to the torture trade
can only empower those who resort to torture and can
only help to legitimize an illegal international practice

====================

We call on all members of the General Assembly to
support the adoption of draft resolution A/73/L.94
today and to join us in adopting this initiative designed
to boost the collective global fight against torture

====================

The Acting President: We shall now proceed to
consider draft resolution A/73/L.94

====================

Before giving the floor for explanations of vote
before the voting, may I remind delegations that
explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and
should be made by delegations from their seats

====================

We thank all colleagues for
voting in favour of this new step towards torture-free
trade. Resolution 73/304 is about encouraging reflection,
debate and the sharing of perspectives and experiences

====================

It was drafted in a balanced and transparent manner

====================

We think this is an important step on which we can
build further work with regard to establishing common
international standards for torture-free trade.
