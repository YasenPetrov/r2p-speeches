(spoke in French): My
delegation aligns itself with the statements made by the
observer of the European Union and by the representative
of Denmark on behalf of the Group of Friends on the
Responsibility to Protect (see A/73/PV.93). We support
the French-Mexican initiative on the use of the veto and
have signed on to the Accountability, Coherence and
Transparency group code of conduct

====================

Luxembourg welcomes the report of the SecretaryGeneral (A/73/898) and commends the work done by the
Offices of Under-Secretary-General Adama Dieng and
of the Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect

====================

Their work in the areas of analysis and early warning
is essential and should be supported both within the
United Nations and on the ground

====================

My country’s commitment to the operationalization
of the norm of the responsibility to protect (R2P) began
with the adoption of the World Summit Outcome
document and is reflected in our unreserved support
for R2P in the various formal and informal multilateral
forums, including, most importantly, in the General
Assembly and during open debates of the Security
Council. We welcome the standing inclusion of the item
on the Assembly’s agenda and urge the adoption of a
resolution affirming the universal commitment to the
vital norm of the responsibility of all States to protect
their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity

====================

Given the importance that my country and all
members of the Assembly attach to the Universal
Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council, we also
advocate for the integration of a prevention approach to
atrocity crimes in the context of the Review

====================

The role of special procedure mandate-holders is
particularly dear to us. Along with the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,

special-procedures independent experts provide highquality information to the Human Rights Council and
often sound the alarm on criminal atrocity situations. We
encourage the Security Council to hold regular briefings
by the High Commissioner and by representatives
of commissions of inquiry or fact-finding missions
mandated by the Human Rights Council

====================

Our informal commitments include the activities of
our national focal point in the Global Network of R2P
Focal Points, with the support of the Global Centre for
the Responsibility to Protect, whose commitment and
resolve we commend. In that context, we encourage
all countries to designate a staff member in their
Administration as a focal point. Luxembourg also
participates in the Group of Friends of the Responsibility
to Protect in New York and in Geneva

====================

Atrocity crimes perpetrated in today’s conflicts are
avoidable, and it is the responsibility of Member States
to prevent them, including through decisive action
against hate speech. If States are not able to fulfil this
responsibility, it is their duty to request assistance
under the second pillar of the norm of R2P. Only as
a last resort should the third pillar of the norm come
into play and the international community intervene

====================

Recent history has taught us that the rhetoric we have
heard against the third pillar of R2P chiefly protects
authoritarian regimes that are prepared to carry out
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes

====================

Moreover, it has been established that impunity
encourages recurrence. Here my delegation wishes to
reiterate its unconditional support for the International,
Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the
Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible
for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law
Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March
2011 and the independent international fact-finding
mission on Myanmar

====================

Fourteen years after the 2005 World Summit and
with 10 years to go on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, Luxembourg reiterates its resolute
commitment to the responsibility to protect and to a
multilateral effective system with the United Nations at
its heart, with the goal of safeguarding human dignity
and an international order that is based on the rule
of law.
