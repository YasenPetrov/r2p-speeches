My delegation
would like to thank the President for convening
today’s meeting

====================

We would also like to welcome Ms. Karen Smith
and congratulate her on appointment as Special
Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Responsibility
to Protect (R2P). We wish her every success in her
new role. Furthermore, we thank Mr. Adama Dieng,

Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, for the
important role his office continues to play

====================

We also welcome the report of the SecretaryGeneral on the responsibility to protect (A/73/898)

====================

We would like to highlight the following five points in
our statement: the importance of prevention, the role
of regional organizations, the women and peace and
security agenda, the protection of civilians and the of
importance of guarantees of non-recurrence

====================

First, with regard to prevention, South Africa
strongly agrees that the prevention of atrocities is
central to the successful implementation of R2P. We
therefore continue to advocate for a sharper focus on
the wide range of tools available to us with regard to
enhanced diplomacy and multilateralism. R2P must, as
its central interest, promote the safety and well-being
of the affected populations and should never be used
to advance the narrow self-interests of those who seek
intervention. Therefore, any Security Council mandate
imposing R2P must be clearly defined and implemented
in the letter and spirit of its provisions. Most important,
it must respect the Charter of the United Nations

====================

The 2005 World Summit Outcome document states
that the application of the responsibility to protect is
strictly limited to genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity. As such, the application
of the concept should be narrow and restricted to those
four identified crimes, while utilizing all the tools
of conflict prevention and resolution available to the
United Nations

====================

Based on South Africa’s experiences of Security
Council resolutions 1973 (2011), concerning Libya,
and 1975 (2011), concerning Cote d’Ivoire, we are
opposed to any open-ended authorization of the use
of force with no accountability, which has led to
regime-change expeditions. Domestic interference
in the internal affairs of Member States should
not be disguised as applying the principles of the
responsibility to protect. When that principle is abused,
it can lead to catastrophic consequences that can result
in the displacement of people, unprecedented migration
and other humanitarian challenges. As the SecretaryGeneral’s report states, the need to strengthen the rule
of law for atrocity prevention is important

====================

The report further calls for action in three main
areas, namely, access to justice, effective and legitimate
security forces, and transparent and accountable
governance. We believe accountability is vital in terms

of justice for victims and the fight against impunity

====================

However, accountability should never be a substitute for
genuine prevention efforts. Furthermore, South Africa,
as the co-Chair of the Group of Friends on Security
Sector Reform, will continue to use that platform
to promote and prioritize negotiations and the use of
good offices, mediation, arbitration and other peaceful
means to address any challenges faced by countries
affected by conflict

====================

Secondly, the role of regional organizations in
conflict prevention cannot be overemphasized. Article
4 of the Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU)
establishes the right of the AU to intervene in the
affairs of a member State to prevent grave violations
of human rights. However, that should be activated
only once all other efforts to mediate the conflict
have been exhausted. It is broadly agreed that the
principle of prevention is more effective than the use
of force in reacting to conflicts, and in that regard, the
African Union Commission operationalized the AU
Mediation Support Unit (MSU) in mid-March 2019

====================

The AU Commission has devoted efforts towards the
strengthening of the MSU, including though capacitybuilding on mediation as well as the mainstreaming
of gender in mediation. That has strengthened the
AU capacity to address conflicts on the continent
in order to avoid costly interventions, which often
lead to the loss of life. The international community
should help build the capacity of Member States and
regional organizations in addressing conflict hot spots
through mediation before activating the principle of the
responsibility to protect. In that regard, we agree with
the Secretary-General’s report with regard to providing
support to national authorities in strengthening their
capacity to prevent atrocity crimes

====================

Thirdly, with regard to the women and peace and
security agenda, as the twentieth anniversary of Security
Council resolution 1325 (2000) approaches, we continue
to call for women’s full participation in political and
economic systems to help in addressing the root causes
of conflict. Women’s perspectives and experiences are
important for early warning that can prevent conflict
and its resurgence. As the Secretary-General’s report
points out, women’s economic empowerment also
contributes positive elements to securing livelihoods
and there is a need to further connect the atrocity
prevention agenda with other global commitments and
priorities, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, especially Sustainable Development

Goal (SDG) 16, on women and peace and security, and
international peace and security

====================

Fourthly, with regard to the protection of civilians,
it is important for the United Nations to periodically
evaluate its response to the protection of civilians
because protecting civilians from the scourge of
conflict is at the core of maintaining international
peace and security. If the United Nations is not seen
to be protecting civilians and if innocent children,
women and men continue to suffer on our watch, we
will have failed the mandate entrusted to us. South
Africa is as such fully committed to the protection of
civilians in armed conflict and continues to support
a strengthened normative and legal framework for
enhancing such protection

====================

Moreover, the Security Council would do well
to consider the advice by the Secretary-General that
preventative action is built on trust, transparency
and accountability. The Security Council should
therefore reconsider the manner in which it executes
its mandate and addresses threats to, and breaches
of, international peace and security. Furthermore, it
should increase its engagement with Member States,
especially those affected by conflict and that are open
to effective engagement with regional and subregional
organizations. Most United Nations peacekeeping
missions include a mandate to protect civilians, and
that should be strengthened to ensure that conflictrelated sexual violence and activities in support of
the disarmament and demobilization of armed groups
are addressed

====================

We wish to underline that it remains the primary
responsibility of States to protect civilians within
their borders. Armed opposition groups also bear the
responsibility of ensuring that unarmed civilians are
protected. A failure by both State and non-State actors
to uphold that principle should not go unpunished

====================

Accountability must first and foremost be sought at the
national level. Failing that, the international community
has a collective responsibility to act in accordance with
international humanitarian law, using mechanisms
at its disposal, including independent fact-finding
commissions and commissions of inquiry

====================

Fifthly, with regard to the importance of guarantees
of non-recurrence, it is important to ensure that those
countries that have experienced such atrocities never
experience them again. National accountability efforts
are also important and among the most effective

ways of preventing the recurrence of atrocity crimes,
as highlighted in the Secretary-General’s report

====================

Guarantees of non-recurrence of mass atrocity crimes
are embedded within United Nations resolutions
and declarations on peacebuilding and sustainable
development, particularly SDG 16, which links social
integration, justice and sustainable peace. It is important
to ensure that we address economic inequalities, which
are often the cause of social tensions when certain
groups in society feel marginalized

====================

In conclusion, South Africa reaffirms its full
support for the mandates of the Special Advisers on the
Prevention of Genocide and on the Responsibility to
Protect and encourages Member States to do the same.
