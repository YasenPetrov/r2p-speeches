Statement delivered by Boliviaâ€“ Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2017
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]
Thank you, Moderator

====================

The Pluri-national State of Bolivia, with its promotion of culture of peace, advocates for the
resolution of conflicts through dialogue, mediation, and preventive diplomacy. Therefore,
we are a state which respects international law and the protection of human rights. So, we
form part of those international laws which ensure that states can guarantee their selfdetermination. We are also part of the Rome Statute, which establishes mechanisms to
persecute and punish perpetrators of crimes against humanity, war crimes and ethnic
cleansing and genocide. We therefore condemn and fully reject these crimes. We therefore
believe the responsibility to protect is an exclusive obligation for each state with their own
populations and a principle duty which must be transposed via respect for fundamental
rights and their promotion

====================

Moderator,
In paragraph 138 and 139 of the Summit Outcome Document of 2005, it recalls the
obligation upon all member states to protect their people from crimes against humanity,
war crimes, ethnic cleansing and genocide. We therefore consider that we absolutely need
to work together in a consensual way towards defining the scope and concepts under the
responsibility to protect until there is an intergovernmental agreement upon its
interpretation and mechanisms to implement it, so in the future, dialogue can take place
towards full implementation. Responsibility to protect needs a clear definition, but we must
not have terms to underpin it, otherwise it could become a mechanism to intervene in each
other states and a tool to try to achieve political ends. We note the proposal of the
Secretary-General and we consider that any action towards implementation of the
responsibility to protect should be done with the full respect to sovereignty, independence,
and the territorial integrity of member states

====================

We reiterate therefore that any action or threat towards unilateral actions from one
member state to another is against the principles of multilateralism and the Charter of the
United Nations. We believe it is important to take into account the terrible consequences of
interventionism and policies aimed at changing regimes in the current global context,
sometimes these undertaken under the responsibility of R2P. Unfortunately, this has led to
chaos, extremism, the proliferation of terrorism and militarization of conflict zones, which
are currently of great concern with to our organization

====================

We would like to conclude by reiterating the fact that an analysis of causes and roots of
conflicts must be carried out in a detailed and careful way. We must not use hypothesis and
suppositions given the disastrous humanitarian situation that we are currently seeing

====================

Thank you very much
