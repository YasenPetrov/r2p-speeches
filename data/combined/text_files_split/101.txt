ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PREVENTION”

NEW YORK
6TH SEPTEMBER 2017

Check against Delivery Mr. President,

Let me from the outset thank the President of the General
Assembly for organizing this interactive dialogue on the 2017 Report of
the Secretary-General on the responsibility to protect entitled "The
responsibility to protect and accountability for prevention". I also
commend the Secretary-General for the painstaking efforts to prepare this

comprehensive report

====================

Mr. President,

2. There is no gain-saying the fact that there is a disturbing trend in
mass atrocity crimes in different parts of the world which requires
collective efforts at national, regional and global levels to address. The
efforts to protect civilians from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and
crimes against humanity require that the conditions that allow for these
crimes to thrive be brought to an end. In other words, beyond the law
enforcement approach, dealing with the political economy of conflicts in a
more holistic manner is crucial to finding potential remedies to the

situation of conflicts and its attendant crimes around the world. Itis in this

J light that Nigeria endorses the emphasis of the Secretary-General on

preventive measures to stop and mitigate mass atrocity crimes

====================


3. Though it is also important for perpetrators of these crimes to be
held accountable, the capacity of States to do so with the prevalence of
weak structures and institutions needs to be addressed. In this regard,
multilateral cooperation should be enhanced to strengthen States’
capabilities in order to deal with the threats posed by violent conflicts.and
crimes against humanity

====================


Mr. President,

4. | We wish to stress that the thriving market in small arms and light
| weapons and weapons of mass destruction has continued to fuel these
conflicts leading to mass atrocity crimes and humanitarian crisis in conflict
areas, especially in Africa. Terrorist, militant and rebel groups continue
to have access to weapons that are used to wreck havoc on communities
in attempts to gain political power or push forward their selfish and

unpatriotic agenda

====================


5. Nigeria has, in recent times, had her fair share of extreme terrorist
activities of Boko Haram in the North East region of the country, which
] have led to huge displacement of about two million people and conflict
related violence against civilians, including women and children that have
been widely condemned. Nigeria has equally made great strides in

degrading and decimating Boko Haram terrorists and collaborating with

====================


Mr. President,

6. Nigeria welcomes the Secretary-General’s recommendations on practical
steps to strengthen accountability. In line with the Secretary-General's
recommendations, Nigeria has appointed a national focal point on the
responsibility to protect, set up the Presidential Committee on Small Arms and
Light Weapons to tackle the issue of proliferation of small arms and light
weapons. A Human Rights Desk has also been established by the Nigerian
military to ensure that the military operates in accordance with their rules of
engagement. The Government has taken measures to enhance the security of
civilians, including women and children in the camps for the Internally Displaced
Persons (IDPs), to reduce their vulnerability and promote their safe return to

their homes and reintegration into the society

====================


6. Nigeria is a signatory to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal
Court. It has put in motion legal remedies for victims of Boko Haram terrorism
which have resulted in diligent prosecution of 203 detained Boko Haram
terrorists in competent courts of law as well as the reintegration, reorientation and
rehabilitation programmes designed to meet the peculiarities of each victim of

violence

====================


7. It has also intensified efforts at de-mining and removal of Improvised
Explosive Devices (IEDs), facilitating military escort of humanitarian workers/aid,

granting access to detention facilities, release of detainees after screening and

of Conduct and Rules of Engagement of the military were revised in December
2015 to address the new trend of violent extremism and the protection of human

rights

====================


8. The Federal Government, on Friday 4° August, 2017, set up an
independent judicial Commission to look into human rights abuses by military

personnel in the country. Its mandate is to, among others,

- Scrutinize compliance of the Armed Forces with human rights obligations
and rules of engagement, especially in local conflict and insurgency
situations

- Investigate alleged acts of violation of international humanitarian and
human rights law under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,
1999 (as amended), Geneva Convention Act, African Charter on Human
and Peoples’ Rights and other relevant laws by the Nigerian security
agencies

- Look at factors that might be hindering the quick resolution of local conflict
and proffer solutions on how to prevent human rights violation in times of

conflict in the future

====================


9. Nigeria has set up programmes to forestall situations that will create
conditions for mass atrocity crime, such as the Presidential Initiative on the North
East (PINE) - a comprehensive recovery blueprint which integrates all actors and
actions into a coordinated set of activities expected to create traction for the rapid

recovery of the North East from the wreckage caused by Boko Haram insurgents

====================

UNDP, UN Women, UNICEF, Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees and International Donors actively working with
Nigeria to ensure the restoration of peace, security and development in the North

and coherence of the work of these UN agencies in the region to enhance

efficiency in order to deliver on their mandates
