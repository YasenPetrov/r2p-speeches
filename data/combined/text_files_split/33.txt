Statement on behalf of The Group of Friends on the Responsibility to
Protect
at the special session of the Human Rights Council on the human
rights situation in Myanmar

Mr. President
This statement is delivered on behalf of Members of the Group of Friends of
the Responsibility to Protect (R2P)

====================

Mr. President,
We condemn the reports of ongoing gross violations of human rights and
abuses committed in Myanmar, in particular in Rakhine State, notably
against Rohingya and other minorities

====================

We are deeply concerned about the dire situation of Rohingya refugees who
fled to Bangladesh. More than 620,000 people – mostly Rohingya – have
fled across the border since 25 August to escape violence, bringing the total
number of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh to more than 800,000. We
remain deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in Rakhine and
the lack of access for humanitarian and UN agencies. We call on the
government of Myanmar to ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian
access to populations in need

====================

We welcome the commitment of the government of Myanmar to implement
the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State as well
as the setting up of the Union Enterprise for Humanitarian Assistance,
Resettlement and Development in Rakhine State. We also recognize initial
steps that were taken by Myanmar regarding the return of refugees, by
signing the Arrangement on Return of Displaced Persons from Rakhine
State with Bangladesh

====================

The Myanmar State Counsellor’s expressed commitment to bringing
perpetrators of human rights violations and abuses and related criminal
acts to justice is a welcome step towards starting a process of
accountability. Those responsible for grave human rights violations and
abuses should be held accountable in accordance with international law

====================

We welcome the generous hospitality of Bangladesh and the strong
commitments made by the Government of Bangladesh to provide

temporary shelter, humanitarian assistance and protection to the refugees
and other forcibly displaced persons

====================

We call on the Myanmar government to fully uphold its primary
responsibility to protect its population, regardless of ethnicity, religion or
citizenship status, to restore safety and security for all people in Rakhine
State and to bring an immediate end to all violence

====================

As a necessary next step, a credible process should be established to enable
and ensure the safe, voluntary, and dignified return of all refugees to their
original places of residence. We encourage Myanmar to work with UNHCR
and other humanitarian partners to enable safe, dignified and voluntary
returns for Rohingya refugees, as well as informed and sustainable returns

====================

We also call on Myanmar to fully cooperate with the Special Rapporteur
and the independent international Fact-Finding Mission – established by
the Council - and allow them safe and unfettered access to all parts of
Myanmar

====================

As the international community recognizes the dire situation in Rakhine
State and the plight facing refugees who have fled to Bangladesh, this
Human Rights Council has a clear responsibility to encourage and help
Myanmar in ensuring that all its diverse populations – regardless of
ethnicity, religion or citizenship status – are fully protected from further
violence and human rights violations

====================
