Statement delivered by the Delegation of Ecuador to the United Nations, at the United
Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion "From commitment to
implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened by the President
of the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
25 February 2016
Ecuador agrees with the concept of Responsibility to Protect but not with its selective
implementation based on a double standard. When we speak about Responsibility to Protect,
we can analyze this concept from the standpoint of the subject, the object and the mechanism

====================

When we speak from the standpoint of the object, resolution 2005 is very clear in that the
international community, through the UN, is called upon to protect populations from genocide,
war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. But, it clearly establishes that one
has to resort to Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter, Chapter VI on the peaceful settlement of
disputes and Chapter VIII on the role of regional organizations. This is a question which
becomes invisible and, at times, one tries to go to the Security Council without even having
gone to the regional organization first to intervene in the process under Chapter VI, peaceful
settlement of disputes, which should be done prior to any analysis of possible intervention
under Chapter VII

====================

With regard to the subjects, one can discuss who will decide this, when can it be done and
how and whether those subjects first acted under Chapter VI and Chapter VIII or not. Also,
Ecuadorâ€™s view is that one has to discuss the question as to the implementation of
Responsibility to Protect in the General Assembly first so that the implementation of this
principle may be viable and legitimate
