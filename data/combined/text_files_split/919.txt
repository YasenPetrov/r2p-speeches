(spoke in Spanish): Bolivia, as a State that believes in
peace and promotes the culture of peace, has always
advocated the resolution of conflict through negotiation,
mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement
and preventive diplomacy, in accordance with the
established purposes and principles of the Charter of
the United Nations

====================

With that as our understanding, and as a country
that respects international law and the need to protect
human rights, we join the universal pacts, treaties and
conventions that establish the responsibility of States
to ensure that they are fully exercised and enjoyed

====================

As a reflection of our commitment to the fight against
impunity when those rights are violated, we signed the
Rome Statute, which sets out mechanisms to punish
and prosecute crimes against humanity, war crimes
and genocide

====================

In view of that, Bolivia believes that the
responsibility to protect is an exclusive obligation of
States to their populations, and a primary duty that
should be reflected by respecting, guaranteeing and
promoting fundamental rights

====================

Paragraphs 138 and 139 of the World Summit
Outcome document of 2005 recall the obligation
incumbent on all States to protect their peoples from
crimes against humanity, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and genocide. It is essential that we work together and in
consensus to define the concepts and scope implied by
the responsibility to protect. This responsibility is not
a principle but rather a concept, whose characteristics,
rules of implementation and evaluation mechanisms are
far from being defined and agreed on. Without a clear
definition and with imprecise terms to support it, the
responsibility to protect has a high risk of becoming
a mechanism for interfering in the internal affairs of
States or being used selectively as a tool to achieve
political gains

====================


While we take note of the Secretary-Generalâ€™s report
(A/72/884) and recognize the key role of the United
Nations in identifying and issuing early warnings in
situations that could become human rights violations,
we reiterate that any action considered as implementing
the responsibility to protect must unquestionably
belong in a framework of respect for the independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. It must
seek to build capacities, not undermine or impair them

====================

That includes the prohibition of the implementation of
policies of intervention or interference. We therefore
reiterate that any action or threat of unilateral action
against a State runs counter to the principles of
multilateralism, international law and the Charter of
the United Nations

====================

It is important to bear in mind that interventionism
and regime-change policies carried out as so-called
preventive or humanitarian interventions have left
gaps in State structures that can tragically lead to
chaos, extremism, the proliferation of terrorism and the
militarization of entire regions, which, unfortunately,
continue to occupy the attention of our Organization

====================

In that understanding, if we really do desire to
prevent and avoid humanitarian disasters, the root
causes of such situations must be addressed. They
include underdevelopment, poverty, inequality, social
exclusion, food insecurity, lack of access to safe water,
the implementation of selective unilateral embargoes
and other structural problems that exacerbate conflicts
until they become unsustainable situations

====================

In conclusion, we note that the report of the
Secretary-General does not reflect the concerns
expressed by several States regarding the need to agree
on a conceptual and methodological framework for the
scope and limits of the responsibility to protect, although
those concerns were recognized during his presentation
in the informal dialogue held on 6 September 2017. Until
those elements have been duly studied, clarified, agreed
on, accepted and recognized by all States, this subject
should therefore not be considered or established as a
permanent item on the agenda of the General Assembly.
