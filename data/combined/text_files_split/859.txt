(spoke in Arabic): At
the outset, I would like to thank the President of the
General Assembly for his initiative to hold this meeting
on the responsibility to protect. This annual debate
will enhance the mandate of the General Assembly to
continue considering this item and will give us a chance
to benefit from different viewpoints and measures
adopted regarding early warning in order to limit the
impact of crises

====================


The 2005 World Summit Outcome document,
which was adopted by Heads of State and Government
on the responsibility to protect citizens from genocide,
war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity, was based on a number of pillars, including
the responsibility of States to protect their citizens and
the responsibility of the international community to
help States and to protect their citizens when States
clearly fail to do so. However, the adoption of this
principle has fallen far short of achieving the intended
objective, given the disturbing developments that we
have seen in the past few years, which threaten to widen
the gap between the commitment of Heads of State
and Government and the realities on the ground that
people throughout the world face as a result of internal
conflicts and the funding that fuels them

====================

Against that backdrop, my delegation would like to
highlight several important points that are at the core of
our discussion today

====================

First, there is a need to enhance early-warning
mechanisms that could help Governments to identify
resentments at their early stages. before they are
exacerbated, and to hold the parties to a conflict legally
accountable and responsible for the damage they
have caused

====================

Secondly, it will not be possible to achieve
successful, peaceful solutions, end crises due to armed
conflict or eliminate the threat of terrorism and its
repercussions until the obstacles to such peaceful
solutions are addressed. They include interference
in the internal affairs of States, wars, divisions and
sedition, along with assisting and funding terrorist
groups. Strict sanctions should be imposed while at
the same time strengthening the role of the Security
Council and accountability mechanisms

====================

Thirdly, monitoring systems should be enhanced
while preventing the emergence of divisions based on
religion, race or doctrine, which can lead to growing
hostility among a countryâ€™s citizens. Extremist
ideologies should be addressed by establishing
cooperation and dialogue between religions and
cultures and identifying common human values

====================

In conclusion, my country underscores its renewed
commitment to a responsibility to protect that must
be supported by action. Early-warning mechanisms
should be based on integrity and reflect a spirit of
professionalism, without any political interference or
double standards.
