http://un.myp.hr Mr President,

Allow me at the outset to thank you for convening a dialogue on the Responsibility to
Protect, an issue which epitomizes the very purpose of this Organization

====================


Croatia aligns itself with the statement delivered by the European Union, and I would like
to make some additional remarks in my national capacity

====================


We appreciate and share the views expressed in Secretary-General’s report on
“Mobilizing collective action: The next decade of the responsibility to protect” and wish
to thank him for placing the advancement of the responsibility to protect at the core of his
engagement, in our joint efforts to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity

====================


We would at the same time call for the next Secretary-General to make R2P one of his or
her core priorities, and to further build on the achievements of the Human Rights Up
Front initiative

====================


In addition, we would like to extend our sincere appreciation for the effort invested and
work carried out by Secretary General’s special adviser on R2P Ms. Jennifer Welsh and
we congratulate Mr. Ivan Simonovié on being appointed as her successor

====================


Mr President,

When it comes to further success in advancing this important agenda, we must firstly
remind ourselves that we are faced with a frightening reality of unprecedented suffering
caused by conflicts in many parts of the world, and thus we have a duty to act when and
where the lives of civilians are threatened

====================


We must also recognize as a severe global threat the emergence of violent extremists and
non-state armed groups who brazenly defy international humanitarian law and glorify
their crimes, thus undermining the fundamental principles of our common humanity

====================


A worrying decline in compliance with international law, including intentional attacks on
schools, hospitals, humanitarian workers, peacekeepers and journalists, is deeply
disturbing

====================


In this context, we reiterate that conflict prevention and sustaining peace must lie at the
core of all our efforts to ensure protection of civilians. This involves reading with
attention early signs, and the effective elimination of root causes of conflict, starting with
the lack of development, justice and respect for human rights. The Framework of
Analysis of Atrocity Crimes is certainly an important tool in this regard

====================


Similarly, we add to the calls for ensuring coherence between R2P and other processes,
which go beyond Agenda 2030 to also include peacekeeping, peacebuilding, and
disarmament. Mr President,

We have stated on multiple occasions that the protection of civilians is first and foremost
a responsibility of national authorities. However, the international community has to take
on its part of the responsibility for protection, and take collective action through the
Security Council if and when national authorities manifestly fail to protect their
populations

====================


Croatia fully supports the code of conduct regarding Security Council action against
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, as well as the French-Mexican
initiative on the suspension of the veto power in cases of mass atrocities

====================


Of critical importance is also ensuring compliance with the obligations of all parties
under international humanitarian law and ensuring accountability when atrocities do
occur. Croatia recalls the further strengthening of the role of the International Criminal
Court (ICC) to take a strong responsibility in prosecuting atrocity crimes committed by
State armies or Non-State Actors

====================


Global and regional networks have become an integral part of the institutional
architecture in encouraging and assisting States to implement the responsibility to protect

====================

Member States have an integral role to play in building capacities, but also should
exercise a greater willingness to share sensitive information on risk factors

====================


It is in this regard crucial to develop comprehensive protection strategies in close
consultation with the host Government, local authorities, contributing countries, the civil
society and other relevant actors

====================


In conclusion, we wish to reiterate our support for the adoption of a substantive General
Assembly resolution on the Responsibility to Protect, as well as for placing the annual
dialogue on the formal agenda of the General Assembly, as small, but significant steps in
translating principles into concrete action to protect the human life and reaffirm the
principle of humanity.
