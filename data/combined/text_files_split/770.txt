(spoke in
Spanish): My delegation associates itself with the
statement delivered by the representative of Denmark
on behalf of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility
to Protect (see A/73/PV.93)

====================

Uruguay is pleased to be part of the group of
countries that requested the inclusion of this item on the
agenda of the General Assembly at its current session
and advocates that it be incorporated as a permanent
item on this organ’s programme of work. In the current
international context, there is the threat of the most
serious crimes against millions of innocent victims

====================

As the main deliberative organ of the Organization,
the General Assembly has the inescapable obligation to
actively and transparently debate possible alternatives
and mechanisms, such as the responsibility to protect,
in order to prevent such crimes, which assail our
collective conscience

====================

Uruguay supports pillars I and II on prevention
as the most effective way to address the responsibility
to protect in the understanding that that is the central
axis of this principle. States are primarily responsible
for protecting their populations. History shows that
no region of the world is immune to the threat of
atrocity crimes. Those crimes find fertile ground
in environments where inequality and intolerance
prevail. All countries must therefore constantly work
to strengthen their respective societies by promoting
development and human rights. In addition, we must
make greater efforts to promote the participation of
women as agents of prevention of atrocity crimes

====================

Uruguay has continued to make progress in
promoting equality and eradicating discrimination

====================

Recent examples are the adoption of the new
comprehensive law on transgender persons, which
provides continuity to and broadens the provisions of
Law No. 17,676, which criminalizes acts of hatred,
contempt or violence against individuals due to the
colour of their skin, their race, religion, national or
ethnic origin or sexual orientation or identity

====================

But, apart from States, the United Nations has a
fundamental role to play. The Security Council, on which
the Charter of the United Nations confers the primary
responsibility for maintaining international peace and
security, must adopt effective measures, including
referring cases to the International Criminal Court

====================

Unfortunately, the Council is often paralysed by the
threat of use or use of the veto. My country reaffirms its
support for the code of conduct of the Accountability,
Coherence and Transparency group and for the
initiative of France and Mexico on voluntary abstention
from the use of the veto by the permanent members of
the Security Council

====================

I would like to emphasize the importance of
peacekeeping operations as one of the main tools for
prevention and early warning. In order to implement
such missions, it is essential to have properly trained
personnel deployed on the ground. Uruguay’s National
Peace Operations Training Institute offers courses on
human rights and the protection of civilians. In that
way, our troops and those of other troop-contributing
countries are trained, including in the area of early
warning. However, it should be noted that, in order for
peace operations to be able to carry out such tasks, it
is also necessary to provide them with the necessary
financial resources

====================

The Human Rights Council is another key body
that the Organization has in order to prevent and
respond to mass atrocities. The Universal Periodic
Review, in particular, is a very important mechanism
for prevention. Uruguay believes that better use should
be made of the human rights system and greater
cooperation should be encouraged with other United
Nations bodies

====================

States must also ensure that perpetrators of atrocity
crimes are investigated and prosecuted. In addition to
being an act of justice, accountability is effective in
preventing such crimes

====================

My country also supports the essential role of the
Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility
to Protect and its Special Advisers in the prevention
efforts of the United Nations

====================

States also have at their disposal mechanisms such
as regional and global networks specialized in the
responsibility to protect and in the prevention of mass
atrocity crimes — effective initiatives to provide and
strengthen the preventive capacities of States. Uruguay
is part of the Global Network of the Responsibility to
Protect Focal Points, as well as the Latin American
Network for Genocide and Mass Atrocity Prevention

====================

In conclusion, Uruguay particularly appreciates
the role played by another actor that we consider
essential: civil society. I would like to take this
opportunity to express my country’s gratitude to the
Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect and
the other non-governmental organizations for their
commendable and dedicated work in defence of life and
human dignity.
