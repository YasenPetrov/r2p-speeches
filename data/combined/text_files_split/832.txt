Myanmar is against any form
of torture and does not condone any such violations

====================

However, my delegation voted against resolution
73/304 because we have strong reservations on the
establishment of such common international standards
where there is no common position on the issue. We
believe that any attempts to regulate trade by setting
standards on the pretext of human rights will undermine
free trade. We also share serious concerns with other
countries over the lack of transparency in the process
of negotiations on the resolution. The negotiations were
carried out in haste and without allowing sufficient
time for representatives to consult with the relevant
trade bodies or experts

====================

The Acting President: We have heard the last
speaker in explanation of vote after the voting

====================

We will now hear statements after the adoption of
the resolution.
