(spoke in Arabic): The
membership of the United Nations has remained
a symbol of State independence and sovereignty

====================

The United Nations has also become the principal
international forum for collective work aimed at
realizing the three objectives of State-building,
nation-building and economic development. The
United Nations has therefore become the main arena
in which the sovereignty of States is strongly defended
and not abandoned

====================

In a world characterized by disparities in power and
resources, in many States sovereignty is the best, and
sometimes the first and only, line of defence. However,
it is more than a functional concept in international
relations. It is a recognition for many States and nations
of their equality in status and dignity with other States
and nations. It protects their unique identity and
national freedom, and asserts their right to determine
their own destiny

====================

States and the international community must
work together to tackle the root causes of internal
conflicts. Required or beneficial interventions should
provide support in terms of meeting existing needs
and addressing the negative political aspects of a
situation, with a view to establishing democracy,
promoting capacity-building and adopting measures
for confidence-building among communities and
various groups, while addressing issues of economic
deprivation and lack of opportunity

====================

Over the past three decades, the urgency of the
problem of dealing decisively with the causes of
environmental deterioration has grown, as it is directly
responsible for internal conflicts and poses a real threat
to the existence of planet Earth. This is a danger not
just to international peace and security but to the very
existence of the human race

====================


Development
assistance
and
cooperation
are necessary in order to counter the inequitable
distribution of resources and opportunities, strengthen
economic growth, enhance the terms of trade, provide
access to international markets for the products of
developing nations, encourage essential economic
and structural reforms and provide technical support
in order to promote the relevant instruments and
organizational institutions. Tackling root causes also
means strengthening legal protections and existing
legal institutions while supporting efforts aimed at
promoting the rule of law and protecting and ensuring
the independence of judicial systems

====================

If our objectives are to strengthen, not weaken, the
sovereignty of States and improve the capacity of the
international community to respond vigorously when
a State commits serious violations of human rights and
fails to protect its citizens, it is essential to reconcile
the two objectives. This issue requires further study
in a spirit of creativity, so as to devise fresh solutions
under the umbrella of international law, in particular
the Charter of the United Nations

====================

We should recall in this regard that a number of great
politicians in the international arena have commented
on the concept of the responsibility to protect by saying
that although the objective is a noble one, the concept
itself gives rise to a number of questions. It is our
conviction that this description is accurate. It certainly
reflects our own position

====================

(spoke in English)
Finally, we have to remember that the post-Second
World War order was built on collective security and
the prohibition of acts of aggression, particularly
inter-State wars of aggression. The peacekeeping and
peacebuilding system has given due and satisfactory
attention to internal conflicts and the attendant risk of
violations. In many, if not nearly all, Security Council
resolutions on situations of internal conflict and
violence, the Council has qualified such situations as
threats to international peace and security. It would
therefore not be possible to perceive the existence of
any vacuum were the current situation not built on a
post-1990 order that is primarily driven by the desire to
consolidate interests and influence

====================

The concept of the responsibility to protect as
advanced today is marred by contradictions in relation
to the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations
and the system of collective security that it created. It

is marred by indifference to the fact that the concept
is being exclusively directed at developing countries
suffering from underdevelopment, environmental
degradation and internal conflict. Indeed, and most
importantly, it is marred by the selective approach that
it fosters, built as it is on mere feasibility. That is why
the concept is theoretically linked to and promoted in
conjunction with the call to promote the jurisdiction of
the infamous International Criminal Court

====================

Ascribing primary responsibility to States as a
justification for advancing the notion of responsibility
to protect is fallacious. The primary-responsibility
principle, as provided for in Article 24 of the Charter,
is linked to the operation of Chapter VII of the Charter
on collective security. The responsibility to protect is a
repudiation of Chapter VII of the Charter.
