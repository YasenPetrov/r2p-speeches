Statement delivered by Ghana – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2017
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]
Thank you, Mr. Moderator

====================

At the outset let me express the appreciation of delegation to the PGA for convening this interactive dialogue
on the report of the Secretary-General on the responsibility to protect. We commend the Secretary-General
for his very comprehensive report, with its far-reaching recommendations and proposals. The focus given to
strengthening accountability in the implementation of the R2P is timely and welcome. My delegation shares
the view that given the current ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis around the world, urgent steps must
be taken by Member States to strengthen accountability for atrocity prevention and to enhance national,
regional and global collaboration on effective preventive strategies. We agree that the pace of the
implementation can be improved through strengthened accountability across the legal, moral, and political
spheres associated with the principle, together with clearly defined relationships between the three. Ghana
is of the view that, R2P principle remains relevant both as an expression of political commitment and as a
blueprint for action to prevent and end genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. We reiterate our
support for the framework for implementation of the R2P, based on the three equal and mutually reinforcing
pillars of the principle. My delegation reaffirms Ghana’s commitments to paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005
World Summit Outcome Document on the responsibility to protect and join in the call for the consistent and
balanced implementation of the principle on the basis of the three-pillar framework

====================

Mr. Moderator,
Ghana shares the view that the ratification and implementation of the core instruments of international
human rights and humanitarian law underpin the R2P. In this regard, we call on Member States to meet the
obligations under these treaties, and to adhere to principles that safeguard humanity. We also the call on
national human rights mechanisms to integrate atrocity prevention into their reports to governments as a
means of enhancing implementation. The Secretary-General’s human rights up front initiative which aims to
improve the system-wide capacity of the organization to prevent and to respond to violations international
human rights and humanitarian law needs to be encouraged and supported. To enhance universal
applicability of and address gaps and challenges in implementation, we must also work towards gaining wider
global acceptance of the concept

====================

My delegation wishes to use this opportunity to thank the government of Qatar and the Global Centre for
hosting the 7th meeting on the global network for R2P, held in April 2017 in Doha. The meeting of afforded
national focal points, including my country and the 58 Member States from every region of the world, the
opportunity to discuss the challenges and opportunities for accountability for mass atrocity crimes, the global
rise in hate speech and xenophobia, and the refugee crisis as well as their collective impact on efforts to
prevent genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Such dialogue must be
encouraged to build consensus and capacity for effective R2P implementation

====================

Mr. Moderator,
As we take stock of how far we’ve come in the last 12 years in our collective efforts towards the
implementation of the principle, my delegation acknowledges the efforts of your good self, we also comment
you for the wide consultations that were held prior to the preparation of the report and also for engaging
with Member States, parliamentarians, global and regional networks of national human rights institutions
and ombudspersons as well as other stakeholders. It is Ghana’s view, that more dialogue is necessary and
specifically we wish to urge Member States to support the request jointly made by Ghana and Australia for
the inclusion of an item on the agenda of the forthcoming session of the General Assembly for a formal

debate on R2P and the prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity

====================

The arguments have just been clearly made and strongly made by the permanent representative of Australia
and Ghana adds its voice to her statement, we strongly believe that sincere transparent and constructive
dialogue will help us find more common ground

====================

In our condemnation of atrocity crimes, crimes against humanity, war crimes, my delegation calls on the
permanent members of the Security Council exercise good leadership and to refrain voluntarily from the use
of the veto in such situations. Finally, we encourage member states that are yet to ratify and to begin
implementation of the core instruments of international human rights and humanitarian law to do so
