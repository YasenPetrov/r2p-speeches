At the outset, I wish
to align myself with the statement delivered by the
representative of Denmark on behalf of the Group of
Friends on the Responsibility to Protect

====================

We wish also to thank Ms. Karen Smith and
Mr. Adama Dieng for their tireless efforts to prevent
atrocities and to protect the people of the world
against them

====================


As most speakers have noted, it is fitting that we
are gathered here again to discuss the responsibility
to protect and the prevention of genocide, war crimes,
ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. I think
that the key word here is the responsibility to protect,
because we have seen that gaps exist and that the need
for prevention and for protecting the people of the world
has become a necessity for us all

====================

We reiterate that the duty to prevent and to halt
genocide and mass atrocities lies primarily — I stress
“primarily” — with Member States, by committing to
protect their own populations against genocide, war
crimes and crimes against humanity

====================

The international community has the moral
authority and the obligation to assist Member States in
fulfilling this primary responsibility. Based on our own
experience in 1994, we find it morally justifiable, if a
State has manifestly failed to protect its own citizens
from mass atrocities and genocide and all peaceful
measures have failed, for the international community
should shoulder the responsibility to intervene through
coercive measures, including military means, in order
to halt acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing

====================

We cannot just sit around and grapple with theories
and principles when the reality is that innocent citizens
are being massacred by those who are supposed to
protect them. In principle, we must agree on the fact
that intervention is warranted

====================

However, this should not legitimize the use
of unilateral coercive measures. The international
community as a whole should be encouraged to expand
multilateral options in order to streamline the nature
and the scope of such interventions. The architects of
such interventions should also refrain from any attempt
to focus their efforts on regime change; rather, more
effort should be put into saving lives and protecting
innocent people

====================

It is of the utmost importance that Governments,
regional organizations and the international community
focus their attention on addressing the underlying
causes of conflict. At the national level, our postconflict experience in Rwanda has shown that this
requires the development of strong institutions that
establish the foundations of good governance based on
the rule of law, democratic principles, shared values
and accountability

====================


Allow me to touch on a few points from the
Secretary-Generals report on “Responsibility to
protect; lessons learned for prevention” (A/73/898),
which was released earlier this month

====================

First, we support the emphasis on preventive action,
which is preferable to responding only after crises have
erupted. We need to avoid the United Nations being used
as a fire extinguisher. Preventive measures should be
an integral part of national, regional and international
mechanisms to prevent atrocity crimes. At the national
level, strengthening the rule of law is an integral element
of prevention. In addition, it is important for postconflict States to invest in efforts aimed at sustaining
peace, such as justice and reconciliation measures

====================

Secondly, we endorse the key recommendations
made in the report of the Secretary-General, including
combating hate speech in the digital space. My country
is well aware of the devastating impact that hate speech
can have if left unchecked

====================

I should like to conclude with
recommendations in three related areas

====================


several

First, concerning accountability, holding those
involved in atrocity crimes accountable is fundamental
to maintaining a credible international system in which
States interact on an equal footing

====================

Secondly, with respect to peacekeeping, Rwanda,
as a top troop- and police-contributing country,
believes that peacekeeping can be a catalytic tool to
stabilize countries where they are deployed, allowing
for a conducive atmosphere for such actors to establish
peace. The Kigali Principles on the Protection of
Civilians enhance peacekeeping missions by placing
the protection of civilians at the heart of peacekeeping
missions. We encourage more Member States to endorse
these Principles

====================

Thirdly, and lastly, I turn to the issue of women
and peace and security. It is unfortunate that sexual
and gender-based violence is a constant feature of
conflicts around the world. States must therefore
carry out interventions that focus on victims of sexual
and gender-based violence, and they must hold those
responsible to account.
