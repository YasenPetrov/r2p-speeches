United Nations Stands Ready to Help
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
Address Dire Humanitarian Situation,
Deputy Secretary-General Tells Security
Council
Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson’s remarks to the Security Council
on the situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in New York, today:
I welcome this Security Council meeting on the human rights situation in the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea. This is a matter of great concern that demands our
attention. The magnitude and scale of abuses suffered by the people of the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea had been documented by the Commission of Inquiry in 2014

====================

The Commission noted that the violations “reveal a State that does not have any parallel in
the contemporary world”. The Commission’s recommendations were instrumental in
reframing the United Nations’ efforts to improve the country’s human rights situation. The
Commission of Inquiry concluded that crimes against humanity have been committed and
rightly called for accountability

====================

The Security Council carried this process further last week by adopting
resolution 2321 (2016). This was the first time the Council specifically requested the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to respect and ensure the “welfare and inherent
dignity” of people in its territory. The General Assembly, in its resolutions on this issue have
repeatedly encouraged the Security Council to ensure accountability, including by
considering to refer the situation in the country to the International Criminal Court

====================

The patterns of grave violations of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea have repeatedly been established. The authorities have given no effective
commitment to remedy the situation. People inside the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea are unable to make their voices heard because of the restrictions and the risks they
face if they exercise their rights. The most vulnerable continue to suffer from a cruel
network of political prison camps, an exploitative economic system and widespread
discrimination based on social status

====================

Two days ago, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report that
assessed the different ways families have been separated since the 1950-53 Korean
War. The report found that involuntary separation is not just the consequence of a war, but
also the result of structural forms of exclusion, impunity and disempowerment

====================


In addition, the country experiences a humanitarian emergency. Approximately 70 per cent
of the population of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea — 18 million people — are
considered food insecure. A quarter of the population has inadequate access to health
services. A fifth of the population lacks access to clean water and proper sanitation. The
impact on children, whose developing bodies are vulnerable to lasting damage, is simply
ruinous. Stunting is a rampant phenomenon

====================

These persistent humanitarian needs are exacerbated by recurring natural disasters, such
as the floods that devastated the north of the country in September, affecting
600,000 people. In line with the “no one left behind” principle of the Sustainable
Development Goals, it is imperative to decouple geopolitical considerations from United
Nations humanitarian and development support to people in need

====================

Security Council resolution 2321 (2016) underlined that the measures imposed were not
intended to have adverse humanitarian consequences for the civilian population. I urge
members of the Council to ensure that the already critical humanitarian situation does not
deteriorate further due to such measures

====================

Funding for relief activities in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is essential, in
particular to ensure that vulnerabilities do not increase in the face of stricter
sanctions. Assistance has steadily declined over the past decade, preventing humanitarian
agencies from responding effectively to the needs of the most affected. About 145 million
dollars are required to address the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s critical
humanitarian needs. I count on Member States to support these life-saving activities

====================

History teaches us that serious human rights violations are warning signs of instability and
conflict. Abduction of foreign nationals, enforced disappearances and people fleeing
desperate situations all demonstrate the links between human rights, humanitarian crisis
and international peace and security. Any attempt to achieve lasting peace and stability
demands justice and redress for victims inside and outside the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea

====================

It is very difficult to obtain up-to-date and comprehensive information about human rights
developments in Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The information we have,
however, reveals a continuing pattern of serious human rights violations. And we see very
few, if any, signs of improvement

====================

The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has obligations under international law. We call
on its Government to abide by them. But the international community also has collective
responsibilities: first, to protect the country’s population from the most serious violations of
international humanitarian law and human rights; second, to live up to the principle and
norm of the Responsibility to Protect; and third, to consider the wider implications of the
human rights situation for regional stability

====================

The United Nations has taken a number of steps recently to address the human rights
situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The new Special Rapporteur
presented his report to the General Assembly in October. Also in October, the SecretaryGeneral issued his report to the General Assembly. The Third Committee has agreed on a
resolution which will be adopted by the General Assembly next month

====================


In response, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has maintained its strong
objections to country-specific resolutions and mandates. While expressing hope for
dialogue and cooperation on human rights, that country’s Permanent Mission said it will
“take all appropriate measures vis-à-vis the hostile acts against the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea that become increasingly aggressive under the pretext of ‘human
rights’”

====================

During his ten years in office, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has made extensive efforts to
promote peace and reconciliation, as well as development and respect of human rights in
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We must remain committed to pursuing
peaceful, diplomatic and political paths forward to deal with this complex and dangerous
situation

====================

The United Nations will continue to work towards ensuring a genuine and lasting
improvement of the human rights and humanitarian situation in the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea. We stand ready to help in all possible ways. This could include human
rights dialogues, visits to the country with sufficient access to assess conditions on the
ground as well as cooperation initiatives and people-to-people contacts

====================

Let us use all the tools at our disposal — the Human Rights Council, the General Assembly,
the Security Council and United Nations and other international entities — to take action to
build a better future for the people of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Thank
you

====================
