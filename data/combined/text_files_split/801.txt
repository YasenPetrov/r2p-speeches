At the outset, let me just say
that I think it is regrettable that some here have injected
political ideas into this forum rather than focusing on
constructive comments on the important topic of the
responsibility to protect

====================

My delegation would like to express its appreciation
to Australia and Ghana for their commitment to this
vital issue, and for promoting a debate in the General
Assembly under a new agenda item. Israel supports the
inclusion of the topic of the responsibility to protect
and the prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity on the formal
agenda of the seventy-second session of the General
Assembly. We would also like to thank the SecretaryGeneral for his report (A/72/884)

====================

As we read the news every day, we are reminded of
the importance of this issue. In every region, from Africa
to the Middle East and from Asia to Latin America, we
see the human toll of conflicts — in lives lost, families
torn apart and the millions of men, women and children
who have been left homeless and even stateless. As the
Secretary-General said, trends continue to move in the
wrong direction. Peace and security seem farther away
than ever, and the price is paid by civilians throughout
the world. We have to reverse those trends

====================

Israel, the nation State of the Jewish people,
understands the importance of the international
community’s responsibility to prevent genocide and
mass atrocities. Our understanding is born of centuries
of torment, persecution and exile, culminating in the
Holocaust — a systematic State-sponsored genocide

that murdered one third of our people. In fact, it is the
atrocities of the Holocaust that led the international
community to pledge “never again”, and to strive to
uphold that promise through the establishment of this
very institution. But our global community has fallen
short. There are still too many instances where that
promise has not been fulfilled. History does not forget,
and it will not forgive the international community if
it does not act to prevent genocide and mass atrocities

====================

Israel’s unwavering commitment to the prevention
of genocide and mass atrocities led us to join the
consensus on the 2005 World Summit Outcome
document (resolution 60/1), including paragraphs 138
and 139, which adopt the principle of the responsibility
to protect. At the same time, we stress that this doctrine
does not create new legal norms or obligations, but
rather must be construed and applied within existing
legal frameworks. Given the fact that this is a novel
doctrine, we want to highlight the need for further
deliberation and discussion. We would like to offer
some preliminary suggestions as to how to make that
principle more effective in practice

====================

For the responsibility to protect to become an
effective doctrine, it must also address the role and
responsibility of non-State actors and terrorist groups
that commit atrocities while blatantly disregarding
international law. Furthermore, the doctrine should
focus only on the most severe situations that involve
mass atrocities, ethnic cleansing or genocide

====================

One of the most important issues with regard to the
responsibility to protect is the primary responsibility of
States to protect their own civilians. The international
community must encourage and assist States in their
efforts to carry out this responsibility. We must maintain
our focus on this aspect of the doctrine and strengthen
our efforts in the areas of early warning and prevention

====================

To ensure effective and long-term prevention of mass
atrocities, we must start at the foundations of States and
societies. We must help States that wish to adopt stable
democratic institutions, based on the institutional
framework of the separation of powers and the rule
of law, to do so successfully. For Israel, those are
not just words. We have extensive capacity-building
programmes in cooperation with United Nations
agencies to help interested States, mainly developing
and post-conflict countries, build and strengthen their
judicial institutions

====================


Another crucial aspect that deserves our focus
is education, particularly for our young people. It
is of the utmost importance that young people today
understand rule-of-law values, human rights, tolerance
and coexistence. A well-known saying warns us that
those who cannot remember the past are condemned
to repeat it. We must ensure that younger generations
are fully equipped with a detailed understanding of
history, including its atrocities and their causes and
repercussions for the affected societies. In Israel, those
elements are a central part of our core curriculum, with
many schools organizing educational delegations to
Holocaust sites in Europe

====================

Paragraph 138 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome
document stipulates that it is the responsibility of
every State to protect its population from the crimes
outlined, including their incitement. The realities on
the ground today show that incitement to hatred and
violence is a growing phenomenon. It has become a
major contributor to the increase in atrocities and other
crimes committed. We therefore believe that greater
attention should be given to the dangerous role of
incitement and ways of countering it when developing a
doctrine for the responsibility to protect

====================

It is our responsibility to ensure that the atrocities
of today do not continue tomorrow. We must never
allow innocent civilians to pay the price of war, and
by developing the most effective doctrine for the
responsibility to protect, through our investment in
capacity-building and education, we can help re-route
our priorities and, in doing so, leave atrocities in the
past and strive for a more peaceful and secure future.
