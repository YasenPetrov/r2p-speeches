Statement delivered by the Delegation of Argentina to the United Nations, at the United
Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion "From commitment to
implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened by the President
of the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
25 February 2016
It is beneficial for us to listen to the views of everyone on this very important concept of
Responsibility to Protect. In the last decade we have maintained an intensive conceptual
debate at the UN on Responsibility to Protect which has allowed us to identify the best ways
in which to implement specific measures to prevent and halt genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity

====================

During this decade member States have recognized their primary responsibility to protect their
populations from the four crimes and have accepted their collective responsibility to assist one
another in implementing such a responsibility. As equal and sovereign all States have
reciprocal rights and responsibilities and, in that regard, we understand that they are all equally
committed to protecting their populations against atrocity crimes

====================

With regard to the UN we have developed a framework of implementation based on three
fundamental pillars which are interrelated. We have also developed the concept in various
bodies of the General Assembly in the framework of the informal dialogues and in the Security
Council. And we have made progress towards crystallizing a concept under Responsibility to
Protect, particularly with regard to prevention. We also emphasize the designation of the
Special Advisors on Responsibility to Protect and the Prevention of Genocide who have the
full support of Argentina

====================

However, and without detriment to this, and going beyond the progress made this decade, we
believe that major challenges remain at the level of implementation and definition of the
concept as well as with regard to the complexities and threats against the populations of the
world. That is why we consider it necessary, in the context, today, to strengthen our collective
commitment to Responsibility to Protect to make progress in its implementation while
continuing to reflect on the three fundamental issues within Responsibility to Protect:
protection of populations, strengthening human rights norms and international humanitarian
law and the fight against impunity

====================

In that regard, we share the views expressed today on the need to go, from informal debates
in the General Assembly, to ensuring that Responsibility to Protect be an item on the agenda

====================

We believe that the General Assembly is the most representative and democratic body in the
UN system where we can continue to deepen this frank and open dialogue among all
members. In this regard, we welcome the draft resolution of the General Assembly on the 10
years after the adoption of the concept and we support concrete initiatives such as that of the
Code of Conduct on action of the Security Council and veto restraint

====================

It is imperative, in our view, that we consolidate a solid strategy of prevention based on an
impartial analysis of events, sufficient resources and political will to react in an early, timely
and organic and sound basis given situations which may place our populations at risk of these
crimes

====================

We believe that prevention must be at the center of all of our efforts. In that regard, we strongly
support the initiative of the UN system to implement prevention on a crosscutting basis,
including peacekeeping operations, Responsibility to Protect, peacebuilding, the importance
of the rule of law, ‘Human Rights up Front’ initiative, among others. Thus, we agree that we

should strengthen the capacity to implement prevention measures and we will continue to do
so

====================

Finally, we would like to reiterate, on the third pillar and the concept of Responsibility to
Protect, that the use of force should be considered only as a last resort, once all preventative
efforts have failed and it should be implemented legitimately, responsibly and proportionally
and only to implement Responsibility to Protect in full compliance with the principles of the UN
Charter and international law

====================
