Statement delivered by Qatar – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2016
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]
Thank you very much, Mister Moderator. I would like to first of all thank you for giving me the opportunity
to take part in the interactive dialogue for this important topic. I would also like to express my appreciation
to the Secretary General for the efforts exerted in order to develop the principle of R2P. We would also
like to thank him for appointing Mr. Simonovic as a Special Adviser for R2P. I would also like to thank the
Representative of the Netherlands for his statement on behalf of the Group of Friends, as we are a
member of this group

====================

Mr. President, the progress achieved in order to build a consensus regarding R2P is considered to be a
hope, which is very important to protect the lives of many millions of people who are suffering from
conflicts as well as violations of human rights. However, it is of our concern that what has been achieved,
in reality, is not up to the level of the aspiration of the international community in order to prevent
atrocities. Such atrocities are increasing in a number of regions in our world. Therefore, we need to have
more effective procedures in order to meet our responsibility to protect civilians. This can be achieved
through the international commitment to the protection of the future of humanity. We would also like to
pay tribute to the efforts of civil society organizations in order to raise awareness about R2P, as well as
highlighting the examples that might be atrocities

====================

Mr. President, we have unprecedented numbers of civilians that are killed, as well as an increasing state
of instability. That is why the R2P principle is very important. Although the collective security is the joint
responsibility of all member states, the Security Council under its mandate has a special responsibility in
order to prevent these atrocities, and it should not use the right to veto in cases that are related to
atrocities

====================

Mr. President, in fact, Qatar is supporting R2P, based on our efforts to protect and end such violations of
international humanitarian law as well as international law. Therefore, Qatar has joined the Group of
Friends of R2P. We have appointed a high-level Focal Point with regards to this topic. In particular to this
regard, Qatar has joined the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency Initiative as well as the initiative
in order to prevent the right of the use of veto

====================

Within the framework of Qatar’s efforts to support R2P, it is my pleasure to announce that Qatar will host
this year’s workshop on R2P for the GCC countries. In 2017, we will also host the 7th meeting of the
National Focal Points regarding R2P. In this regard, our center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies at
the Doha Institute is carrying out a very important role in providing experts to our region by helping these
countries to confront such crises as well as confronting the transitions in the MENA region. We are also
teaching the response to conflicts as well as peaceful settlements, which is regarding one of the most
important 2030 Agenda objectives

====================

In conclusion, Mr. President, supporting R2P, as well as the vast support to the GA, is a manifestation of
the international community’s commitment to protect civilians as well as the respect of the rule of law
and fighting impunity

====================

Thank you very much
