UNITED NATIONS
PRESS RELEASE

Statement by Adama Dieng, Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, on the situation of
civilians in the Syrian Arab Republic
(New York, 9 May 2016) Responding to the deadliest two weeks since the Cessation of Hostilities
accord, which came into effect on 27 February 2016, the Special Adviser on the Prevention of
Genocide, Adama Dieng, expressed his outrage at the ongoing indiscriminate and seemingly
calculated attacks against civilians and civilian objects in Syria

====================

“Between 27 April and 5 May 2016, there were at least six attacks on medical facilities by different
parties to the conflict in the north-western governorate of Aleppo alone. The attack against the Al
Quds Hospital on 27 April reportedly killed 55 civilians, including the last pediatrician in the city” –
noted the Special Adviser. On 5 May, an attack on the Kamouna Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)
camp in northern Idlib governorate killed at least 30 civilians

====================

“These attacks reflect the continued blatant disrespect of international humanitarian law by all parties
to the conflict, and may constitute war crimes”, the Special Adviser stated. “The international
community cannot allow the perpetrators of flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and
human rights law to enjoy impunity. Just a few days ago, in its Resolution 2286 on Healthcare in
Armed Conflict, the Security Council reiterated the need for Member States to uphold their
obligations under international humanitarian law and ensure that the responsible parties are held to
account. It is crucial that the Council consistently apply this principle”

====================

The Special Adviser concluded: “The Member States have a duty not to fail the Syrian people yet
again and to uphold their pledge to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, crimes against
humanity and ethnic cleansing. In this respect, the international community should step up its
commitment to end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes in Syria and thus
contribute to preventing new atrocities from being committed. For this reason, I strongly support the
Secretary-General’s repeated calls to the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the
International Criminal Court”
