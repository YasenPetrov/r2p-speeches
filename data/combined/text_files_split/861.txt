As a party to the
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman

or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Indonesia is
committed to the full implementation of the Convention

====================

Furthermore, Indonesia believes that the international
community should cooperate to fulfil the provisions of
the Convention aimed at preventing and responding to
torture and other ill treatments

====================

The draft resolution with which we are presented
(A/73/L.94) has an underlying purpose that is not
completely aligned with the Convention. The proponents
seek to end trade in goods used to carry out the death
penalty and torture. This goal is problematic in that it
conflates the death penalty with torture and other ill
treatment, which is an issue of principle. Our national
legislation affirms that the death penalty is a legitimate
form of punishment for the most serious crimes in our
society. It is also justified by international law. It is very
unfortunate that the request by delegations to delete all
references to the death penalty was not accommodated

====================

We also regret that the proposal to use such inclusive
mechanisms as open-ended working groups was not
accommodated in the draft resolution. The proponent
insisted on the establishment of a group of governmental
experts without a clear mandate, parameters or terms
of reference. Inclusive mechanisms would allow more
experts and Member States to contribute to the process
and increase ownership over the result. We therefore
continue to advocate for the formation of an openended working group

====================

Turning to the procedural aspects, the way in which
this draft resolution was deliberated seems to confirm
the trend of undermining multilateralism. Consensus
is no longer the norm. The drafting of documents is
merely an exercise in imposition rather than genuine
deliberation. We regret that the draft resolution did not
undergo due process

====================

First, the three informal consultations, held over
such a short period, were not sufficient to allow for a
meaningful exchange of ideas. Moreover, many of the
questions raised by various delegations, including ours,
were not answered

====================

Secondly, the strong trade element in the draft
resolution should have been discussed by trade experts
as well. Instead, the consultations were mainly attended
by human rights experts. We argue that this should be
discussed first in Geneva, which hosts both trade and
human rights experts of the United Nations system,
thereby leveraging United Nations expertise

====================


Thirdly, the draft resolution was not built on the
consensus that is embodied in resolution 72/163, which
we will revisit this year. The resolution already has a
provision to prevent and prohibit the production, trade,
export, import and use of equipment that has no practical
use other than for the purpose of torture or other cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment

====================

Indonesia is ready to support a consensus-based
process. For the reasons I mentioned, we will not support
the draft resolution and will abstain in the voting.
