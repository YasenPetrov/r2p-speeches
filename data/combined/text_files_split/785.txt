The Czech
Republic aligns itself with the statements made earlier
by the observer of the European Union and by the
representative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of Friends
of the Responsibility to Protect (see A/72/PV.99)

====================

I thank Secretary-General António Guterres for
his valuable report (A/72/884), whose conclusions we
broadly share. As a member of the Group of Friends
of the Responsibility to Protect, the Czech Republic
remains fully committed to that responsibility. We
call for the full and consistent implementation of all
three pillars in line with paragraphs 138 and 139 of the
2005 World Summit Outcome document (resolution
60/1). The Czech Republic stresses the importance
of prioritizing and meaningfully investing in the
prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity

====================

I would like to thank Finland and Mexico for
having recently convened the eighth annual meeting
of the Global Network of R2P Focal Points, as well
as the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect
for its hard work. In line with the Secretary-General’s
report, we encourage all Member States to appoint their
national responsibility-to-protect focal points and join
the growing global network

====================

All Member States must uphold their obligations
under international human rights law and humanitarian
and refugee law, which underpin our commitment to
the responsibility to protect. We condemn the growing
number of deliberate attacks on civilians, humanitarian
workers, journalists, peacekeepers, hospitals, schools,
places of worship and cultural sites

====================

The Czech Republic stresses the need for the
Security Council to act effectively and consistently
when faced with mass atrocity situations. In that regard,
we welcome the code of conduct of the Accountability,
Coherence and Transparency group regarding Security
Council action against genocide, war crimes and
crimes against humanity, and the French and Mexican
initiative on voluntary restraint on the use of the veto by
the permanent members of the Security Council, aimed
at supporting timely and decisive action by the Security
Council to prevent atrocities. Ensuring accountability
for mass atrocity crimes is one of the best ways to prevent
them from recurring. National accountability efforts
should be strengthened, as States have the primary
responsibility to investigate and prosecute crimes
committed within their jurisdiction. The International
Criminal Court remains the most important institution
in the struggle to end impunity for genocide, war crimes
and crimes against humanity. The Czech Republic
continues to support the Court and provides financial
support for the accountability mechanisms established
by the United Nations, including the Impartial and
Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation
and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most
Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in
the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011, established
under resolution 71/248

====================

The Czech Republic is concerned about the fact
that sexual and gender-based violence is increasingly
employed as a deliberate strategy by State and
non-State perpetrators. We remain determined to help
combat sexual and gender-based violence in conflict
and post-conflict countries. In partnership with
non-governmental organizations, the Czech Republic

implements projects aimed at preventing sexual
violence and abuse of women and girls, including
through setting up centres for marginalized and abused
girls, as well as by providing for the health care and
hygienic needs of internally displaced persons in Syria,
Lebanon, Yemen, Libya, South Sudan, Iraq, Pakistan,
Jordan and Bangladesh

====================

As a candidate country for the Human Rights
Council, the Czech Republic remains committed to the
responsibility to protect. We encourage the preventive
role of the Human Rights Council, in accordance
with its mandate. We stress the important role that
Geneva-based institutions and mechanisms such as
the Universal Periodic Review and special procedures
mandate-holders can play in preventing and responding
to mass atrocity crimes, as well as the importance of
regular Security Council briefings on mass atrocity
situations by the United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights

====================

I would like to assure members that the Czech
Republic is ready to explore all possible ways of
translating the concept of the responsibility to protect
into concrete action.
