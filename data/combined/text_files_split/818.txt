(spoke in Spanish):
I thank and commend the President of the General
Assembly for holding this plenary meeting on an issue
of great importance that requires serious and thorough
analysis by the General Assembly. We would also
like to convey our gratitude, through the President,
to the Secretary-General for his tenth report on the
responsibility to protect (A/72/884), which focuses on
early warning and the early adoption of measures. I
also thank the delegations of Australia and Ghana for
their facilitation efforts

====================

The State of Ecuador believes that the responsibility
to protect is an issue that cannot be taken lightly

====================

Although the concept has a humanitarian basis, it is
also true that it must be implemented based on premises
that do not undermine the guarantees provided to and
the sovereignty of States

====================

In 2005, we supported the adoption of General
Assembly resolution 60/1, which endorsed by consensus
the 2005 World Summit Outcome document, which
clearly established the three pillars that should underpin
the idea of the
​​ responsibility to protect. The first is
identifying the State as the entity with the primary
role of protecting its population from genocide, war
crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity

====================

The second emphasizes the role to be played by the
international community through cooperation and the
provision of assistance, in order to enable States to
build local capacity that will enable them to meet their
responsibilities. The third is to enable the international
community to take collective measures, in accordance
with the norms and procedures established in the
Charter of the United Nations, that is, through the
Security Council, in accordance with Chapters VI and
VII of the Charter

====================

The Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador sets
out, as a fundamental principle of coexistence, the
need to guarantee full respect for human rights and
the obligation of States to fight for their realization

====================

We therefore believe that the three pillars should be
implemented in strict accord with national policy and in
chronological sequence, with priority always accorded
to the first two, on the understanding that the third, and
any eventual use of force, should come into play only in
exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, and only
by resolution of the Security Council, in accordance
with Chapters VI and VII of the Charter and other
established norms and principles

====================


We reiterate that only the General Assembly has the
legal capacity and authority to define the responsibility
to protect and, more specifically, to identify the
conceptual, institutional and political dimensions of the
task of its implementation. Although the responsibility
to protect is a concept that requires further analysis
and discussion among the States Members of the
Organization, we trust that this new format for debate
will give us the opportunity to discuss it with greater
interest and political commitment, in a transparent and
constructive manner, and to seek to protect civilians
wherever atrocity crimes are committed, impartially
and without selectivity

====================

There is a clear recognition of the fact that the
upsurge of conflicts in the world is linked to situations
of discrimination, marginalization, exclusion and the
illegal occupation of foreign territory. Such conflicts
cannot be resolved through the simple use of force

====================

For this reason, Ecuador emphasizes that conflict
prevention through the peaceful settlement of disputes
is the best way to prevent the commission of atrocity
crimes. The best way to prevent conflict and the most
expeditious way to strengthen national capacities
lies in building confidence in the law and in public
international law, and we must ensure respect for the
institutions established to that end and accountability
for them

====================

With regard to accountability, we want to highlight
the role played by the International Criminal Court in
the maintenance of international peace and justice, in
safeguarding the rule of law and as an essential element
in conflict prevention and the provision of reparations
to the victims of the most serious crimes. We therefore
reiterate our support for the Court as a mechanism that
is uniquely designed to tackle impunity. We call on all
States to accede to the Rome Statute so as to ensure
its universality

====================

Finally, we reiterate our confidence in the role played
by regional and subregional organizations in preventing
conflicts and the commission of the aforementioned
crimes. Often early-warning mechanisms can avert a
crisis of greater proportions or prevent a situation in a
country from deteriorating and leading to an outbreak
of violence against the civilian population, which
generally affects the most vulnerable of its members.
