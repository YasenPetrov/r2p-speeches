Secretary-General's remarks to the
General Assembly debate on the
responsibility to protect [as
delivered]
I welcome this formal debate of the General Assembly on the responsibility
to protect. The first as it was said, since 2009

====================

Such discussion is more critical today than ever as we strive together to
protect people from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity

====================

Global leaders unanimously endorsed the responsibility to protect at the
2005 World Summit. Following genocides, a decade before in Rwanda and
Srebrenica, and coming at a time of profound global divisions, this was a
breakthrough. The imperative was clear: do more to protect people, and do
so as a united international community

====================

Yet today there is still fear that the principle could be used to take collective
action for purposes other than those agreed in the World Summit Outcome

====================

There are also concerns about possible double standards and the selective
use of the principle in the past

====================

That is why open and frank exchanges such as this are necessary to dispel
misconceptions and mistrust. We have to forge mutual understanding and
establish stronger support for the responsibility to protect as a key tool of
protection and prevention

====================

Let us remember that the primary responsibility for protecting people rests
with States

====================

As the World Summit Outcome document says, and I quote, “Each

individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations ... This
responsibility entails the prevention of such crimes, including their
incitement ... We accept that responsibility and will act in accordance with
it”

====================

Indeed, protecting its people is a fundamental part of the exercise of the
national sovereignty of a State

====================

In that spirit, my latest report on the responsibility to protect proposes
various steps that States can take to strengthen their capacities, including
conducting national risk assessments and designing policies to address any
vulnerabilities

====================

Expanding the participation of civil society is also critical in enhancing early
warning and in ensuring the effectiveness of national human rights
institutions and ombudspersons

====================

I also encourage Member States to ratify and domesticate instruments of
international law that relate to the prohibition and prevention of the crimes
and violations referred to in the Summit Outcome

====================

As of today, 45 Member States have still not ratified the Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. In a year when we
mark the Convention’s 70th anniversary, achieving universal ratification
would send a welcome signal of resolve

====================

Let us also recall that the international community has a responsibility to
support States in fulfilling this task

====================

Again, let us listen to the words of the World Summit Outcome: “The
international community, through the United Nations, also has the
responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful
means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter, to help to
protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity.”
Regional organizations have a role to play in helping Governments to
address the risks and precursors of atrocity crimes

====================

Networks of States can also be valuable in developing partnerships,
mechanisms and good practices. In the past month, approximately one-third

of the Members of this Assembly met twice to advance such efforts: first in
Kampala, together with civil society organizations, under the umbrella of the
Global Action Against Mass Atrocity Crimes; and again in Helsinki, for the
annual meeting of Global Focal Points on the Responsibility to Protect

====================

The United Nations will continue to support Member States, especially those
that might be facing fragility and stress, in strengthening institutions,
defending human rights and fortifying the cohesion of society. This is an
essential part of my prevention agenda. The Office of my Special Advisers
on Genocide Prevention and on the Responsibility to Protect provides vital
support in this regard

====================

Only when peaceful means are inadequate, and national authorities are
manifestly failing to protect their populations, may there be a responsibility
for collective action

====================

Here, too, let us be clear: The responsibility to protect does not create a new
mechanism for intervention or coercion

====================

The Outcome Document stipulates that any such action is to be carried out
“through the Security Council, in accordance with the Charter, including
Chapter VII, on a case-by-case basis”

====================

It is clear that today’s discussion takes place against a backdrop of atrocity
crimes being committed at a scale and ferocity not seen in years, with little
regard for international human rights and humanitarian law

====================

We are witnessing deliberate attacks against civilian and non-military
infrastructures, such as hospitals and schools, leading to large-scale civilian
casualties

====================

We are seeing rampant sexual violence; the denial of life-saving aid; and
widespread and systematic targeting of specific ethnic groups, that could
amount to acts of genocide

====================

None of these crimes is “inevitable” or a by-product of conflict. All atrocity
crimes are preventable and can never be justified. This was the reason for
my official letter to the Security Council last August on the plight of the
Rohingya in Myanmar

====================


It is important to build the consensus needed to mount desperately needed
responses to ease suffering and to end violence

====================

Our over-arching challenge is to uphold the principle while preventing its
mis-use. That means acting promptly, preventively, diplomatically, before
situations escalate and spiral out of control

====================

A positive example was set by the international community when it decided
to act in the Central African Republic when there was a high risk of a
genocidal killing spree

====================

An International Commission of Inquiry established by the Security Council
later concluded that timely action by the African Union, the UN
peacekeeping operation and French peacekeeping forces amid ongoing
fighting prevented an even greater explosion of violence

====================

The World Summit Outcome stresses the need for the General Assembly to
continue consideration of the responsibility to protect. And I strongly
encourage you to do so

====================

We need to support the efforts of inter-governmental bodies to prevent
atrocity crimes, including by making better use of the tools at the disposal of
the Security Council such as accountability mechanisms

====================

At this time of extreme challenges, we must not abandon the responsibility
to protect or leave it in a state of suspended animation, finely articulated in
words but breached time and again in practice

====================

Lofty principles mean little if they cannot be applied when they matter
most

====================

The credibility of the international community, and above all the lives of
millions, rest on us

====================

Thank you

====================
