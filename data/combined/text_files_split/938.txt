We meet today to address
in this setting an issue that has been a long time in the
making. The item on the agenda touches on differing
philosophical bases of inter-State ties, varied historical
experiences in the interpretation of key concepts and
sharply divergent recent experiences in translating
international precepts into practice. It is therefore
understandable that the process of deciding whether or

not to even debate the subject has led to the articulation
of strong arguments on either side of those fault lines for
the many years since the Assembly debated it in 2009

====================

For its part, India supported the inclusion of the
item on the agenda of the General Assembly at its
seventy-second session. We did so because we believe
that normative issues, however complex and sensitive,
should be debated. At the core of that approach is
the belief that ideas matter. Our hope is that today’s
discussion will enhance our understanding of the
fundamental precepts involved and place on record
the commonalities, as well as bring to light different
perspectives and provide an opportunity to assess
where we all stand

====================

India’s consistent position is that the responsibility
to protect its population is one of the foremost
responsibilities of every State and that the right to life is
one of the those from which no derogation is permitted

====================

We draw that not only from our present Constitution,
but from a historical tradition imbued with the same
belief. A rock edict of Emperor Ashoka in the third
century B.C. had the inscription:
“This is my rule: Government by the law,
administration according to the law, gratification
of my subjects under the law and protection through
the law.”
We therefore firmly believe that in today’s
internationalist global order, individual States can
and should be encouraged and assisted to meet such
responsibilities. Indeed, it is the responsibility of our
generation to support the evolution of such norms
of legitimacy

====================

In short, India, like many others, has little
disagreement with the rationale of the cardinal features
of the first and second pillars of the responsibility to
protect. However, we are of the view that appropriate
ways should be found to address the legally complex
and politically challenging issues that underlie the
third pillar. In our view, the ability of the international
community to take appropriate collective action if
a State manifestly fails to fulfil its responsibility to
protect its population is still riddled with serious gaps
that must be reflected on

====================

The quest for a more just global order should not take
place in a manner that will undermine the international
order itself. Resorting to force by States acting on behalf
of the international community through intervention,

as a legitimate means of enforcing rights in the face of a
State’s perceived inability to fulfil its responsibilities in
that regard, is contrary to the internationalist impulse
of our age

====================

Experience shows that implementing the notion
of the responsibility to protect in order to prevent or
stop major internal abuses within a State has in several
instances been used to frame or justify interventions
by external Powers. They include instances when the
Security Council failed to agree to intervene under
Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations and
other instances when mandates have been interpreted in
a manner not envisaged by all actors. Such interventions
have destabilized entire regions and have often been
perceived to have been undertaken to further the
strategic interests of certain Powers

====================

At the same time, there have arguably been
other instances, well known and otherwise, in which
major abuses have been committed or continue to be
committed with impunity. Many such situations of
non-action can be attributed either to a lack of strategic
interest on the part of some or, worse, to the fact that
their specific interests will not allow for any change in
the status quo

====================

While the responsibility to protect, at its core, has
an appeal as a noble cause, it has been selectively used
in the context of a wider geostrategic balance of power
among competing players or groups. We are all aware
of the many critical questions that must be addressed
if that noble cause is to be pursued in an impartial
manner. How can we ensure the commonly accepted
legal definitions of the crimes we are discussing? What
will qualify as a trigger for action by the international
community? Which body is competent to take such
a decision? What happens if such a body is grossly
unrepresentative of the wider international community
and of contemporary global realities? What happens
if the record of such a body in addressing common
challenges and, consequently, its legitimacy, is in
serious question?
In short, it is our view that the current system
of collective international security, which should
be enforced through the Security Council, cannot
isolate the implementation of a concept such as the
responsibility to protect from double standards,
selectivity, arbitrariness and misuse for political gains

====================

The requirements that are essential to implement
the responsibility to protect — such as just causes,

right intentions, last resorts, proportional means,
reasonable prospects and the right authority to take a
decision — remain elusive and contested. Though there
is no common understanding on such concepts related
to the four crimes referred to in the 2005 World Summit
Outcome document, some have even sought to expand
the scope of the responsibility to protect to include
situations that may arise from pandemics, climate
change and natural disasters. We get into even greater
difficulty in such scenarios

====================

The current architecture of peace and security
is similar to the philosopher Bertrand Russell’s
description of the world in 1931: “The universe is all
spots and jumps, without unity, without continuity,
without coherence or orderliness”. Proceeding with
perilous interventions in such a situation is tantamount
to placing belief in a false prophet

====================

At this stage, there remain huge and glaring gaps
in building a common understanding on how or even
whether to proceed with such a concept in the present
system of global governance. Investing common
political will in building more representative and
inclusive governance structures nationally and globally,
strengthening capacities in global structures for greater
opportunities for much wider sections of populations
and for nations, and providing more equitable access to
resources to build and sustain peace and prosperity are
requirements that we continue to fall short in fulfilling

====================

We hope today’s debate will serve as a barometer
of the distance that we must all travel to meet our quest
for a common understanding of this important subject

====================

We should address issues in a more holistic manner so
as to ensure that the concept that we are debating today
can acquire the legitimacy that it deserves.
