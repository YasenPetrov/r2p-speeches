Statement delivered by Argentina – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2016
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]
Thank you moderator. First of all Argentina would like to welcome the 9th report of the Secretary-General
on the Responsibility to Protect, which highlights the vital importance of prevention and mobilization of
collective action to protect people against crimes against humanity. We should also like to thank the
President of the General Assembly Peter Thomson for being here and are grateful to the valuable
interventions from our distinguished panelists. Argentina continues that all states being equal and
sovereign have reciprocal rights and responsibilities and all must be equally committed to protecting their
people in cases of atrocity crimes through the respect for international law, and in particular the respect
for humanitarian law, human rights laws and the rights of refugees as well as by combatting impunity

====================


In the United Nations, we have developed an implementation framework based upon three fundamental
and interlinked pillars, which has been further consolidated in various instances of the General Assembly
and Security Council. However, we consider that it is necessary to strengthen our collective commitment
to the Responsibility to Protect, particularly by taking prevention as a tool to protect our populations. It is
crucial that we consolidate solid prevention and accountability strategies which are based upon impartial
analysis of events, sufficient resources and political will. In order to react in a timely, early, organic and
emphatic way in situations which put our people at risk of suffering atrocity crimes. To this end, and given
the need to strengthen accountability amongst the perpetrators of atrocity crimes, Argentina wishes to
highlight the role of the International Criminal Court. Ratification of the Rome Statute is essential to
protect communities given its contribution to combatting impunity and as a deterrent mechanism. Thus,
we invite all member states to accede to the Declaration on Safe Schools, in support of which, my country
was privileged to be able to organize the second international conference in March this year in Buenos
Aires. Argentina firmly supports all initiatives of the United Nations system to implement prevention in a
cross-cutting way such as the Responsibility to Protect, the Peacekeeping Operations, Peacebuilding
Operations, the promotion of the Rule of Law, and the initiative Human Rights Upfront, amongst others

====================


We would also like to highlight the contribution of the Global Focal Points Network on the Responsibility
to Protect. It is made up of 59 member states including Argentina, and it is a tool to build individual and
collective capacity in order to prevent massive atrocities. Moderator, Argentina also highlights the positive
role of regional and sub-regional organizations in conflict resolution, prevention, response and earlywarning mechanisms. This early warning must be fair, prudent, professional and free of political
interference or double standards in the face of threats which have the potential to become atrocities

====================

At a national level, it is important to apply human rights in a cross-cutting way in public policies. Those in
the public sector and those in civil society can work together to increase the public’s awareness of the
idea of respect for human rights and what that implies

====================


Lastly, I would like to express our support for the work of the Office for the Prevention of Genocide and
the Responsibility to Protect and the crucial work of both special advisors in such a relevant area for our
country. Moderator, finally, and with an eye on the future, Argentina wishes to reiterate the need to
strengthen and deepen our commitment to the Responsibility to Protect. We must also redouble our
efforts to ensure its full implementation and highlight once again the fundamental role of prevention and
accountability in a cross-cross-cutting way in all our efforts and initiatives

====================
