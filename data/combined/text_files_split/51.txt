 Statement of HE. Janis MaZeiks,
Permanent Representative of Latvia to the United Nations
On behalf of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania
at the 9th informal interactive dialogue of the UN General Assembly on
the Responsibility to Protect
New York, 6 September 2017

 

Mr. President,

1 am honored to speak on behalf of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. [We also
align with the statement of the European Union.]

We thank the UN Secretary-General for the ninth report on this important
topic. We fully support his recommendation to do better to implement the
responsibility to protect (R2P) in practice by strengthening accountability for
prevention. Implementation of R2P goes hand in hand with his broader appeal
for peace and prevention of conflicts

====================


There is broad international consensus about why R2P matters, but
considerable difficulties in the implementation of this concept remain. Not
only at national level, but also we, the international community, often fail
collectively to take the necessary steps to protect populations from the worst
crimes. Conflicts and mass atrocity crimes put a devastating toll upon
humanity. Senseless human suffering must never become acceptable

====================


Therefore we, the Member States, and the international community as a whole,
must translate our words of commitment into practice

====================


Prevention of mass atrocity crimes and protection of civilians is the primary
responsibility of individual States. We sce it as accountability of authorities
to their people, and of individual States to the international community

====================

Success of R2P can be only as strong as the domestic capacity â€” accountable,
political leadership and strong institutions, and respect for the rule of law

====================


Preventive tools are at our disposal; they just need to be used when risks of
atrocity crimes occur. By fully implementing the 2030 Agenda, we can
mitigate the root causes of conflicts. We must learn how to translate early
warning signs into timely preventive action. For us, human rights, good
governance and the rule of law are central in conflict prevention. We appreciate the work of civil society and media in increasing public awareness about
serious crimes and human rights violations

====================


Early action and response of the UN is critical for the R2P implementation

====================

We commend the persistent work of the UN Special Adviser to advance the
R2P agenda across the UN system

====================


The Security Council has a special responsibility to take timely and decisive
action to prevent the outbreak of brutality against innocent people

====================

Unfortunately, on many occasions the privilege of the veto has been abused
and left the Council paralyzed. We therefore support the proposal to voluntarily
restrain the use of the veto at the Security Council in situations involving mass
atrocity crimes, and the Code of Conduct for any member of the Council not to
vote against any action designed to end and prevent mass atrocity crimes

====================


Ensuring accountability for mass atrocity crimes is the best way to prevent
recurrence of such crimes. Our countries are strong supporters of the work of
the International Criminal Court. Referrals to ICC by the UN Security Council
are necessary when there is evidence that atrocity crimes are being committed
with impunity. Cooperation by States is crucial to the success of the ICC

====================

Another important aspect is to activate the Kampala Amendments to the Rome
Statute on the crime of aggression by the end of this year

====================


Mr. President,

Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania remain committed to the implementation of
the responsibility to protect. We call on other UN Member States to uphold
this important political commitment

====================


We also support a formal General Assembly debate on the R2P in the future

====================


Thank you.
