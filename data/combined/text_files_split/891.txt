I have the honour to deliver
this statement on behalf of the Group of Friends of the
Responsibility to Protect, which consists of 50 Member
States and the European Union and is co-chaired this
year by Italy and the State of Qatar

====================

We would like to thank the President of the
General Assembly and the Secretary-General for their
statements, and Australia and Ghana for their leadership
in including the responsibility to protect on the agenda
of this session of the General Assembly. We would also
like to thank the Secretary-General for his report entitled
“Responsibility to protect: from early warning to early
action” (A/72/884). We commend his prioritization of

early warning and early action to prevent genocide, war
crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity
and for recognizing that the responsibility to protect is
a key element of that important agenda. We welcome
the report’s recommendations and encourage Member
States to implement them

====================

The commitment made by all States Members
of the United Nations to the responsibility to protect
at the World Summit in 2005 was historic. The
Group of Friends reaffirms its strong commitment
to paragraphs 138, 139 and 140 of the World Summit
Outcome (resolution 60/1) and the three pillars of the
responsibility to protect

====================

Today marks the first formal debate of the General
Assembly on the responsibility to protect since 2009

====================

The inclusion of the responsibility to protect on the
Assembly’s formal agenda reflects the will of the wider
United Nations membership regarding the prevention
of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity
and ethnic cleansing. We urge the United Nations
membership to consider the merits of including the
item permanently on the formal agenda of the General
Assembly. Continued dialogue in the Assembly
will promote the building of consensus on what the
international community can do to prevent such
heinous crimes

====================

The acceptance of the responsibility to protect
through the World Summit Outcome remains a key
commitment of the international community to protect
populations that face the threat of genocide, crimes
against humanity, war crimes, and ethnic cleansing. At
this time, the Group would like to reiterate its common
understanding that the responsibility to protect
reinforces, rather than undermines, State sovereignty

====================

As the Secretary-General underlined in the presentation
of his priorities to the General Assembly earlier this
year, it is necessary to overcome the false contradiction
between human rights and national sovereignty. Human
rights and national sovereignty go hand in hand. The
achievement of human rights strengthens States and
societies, thereby reinforcing sovereignty. States with
effective, accountable institutions are among the best
defenders of human rights

====================

Since 2005, considerable progress has been made
by the United Nations, Member States and other
stakeholders, including civil society, in operationalizing
our commitment to the responsibility to protect at the
national, regional and international levels. International

and national actors have been successful in creating
frameworks for identifying risks, developing earlywarning mechanisms, articulating inhibitors of atrocity
crimes and creating new institutional mechanisms

====================

Today’s formal debate gives States an important
opportunity to share national experiences, best practices
and effective strategies for preventing atrocities

====================

Over the past decade, we have seen the creation and
expansion of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility
to Protect in both New York and Geneva, the
establishment and growth of the Global Network of
R2P Focal Points, and the inclusion of the responsibility
to protect in at least 69 Security Council resolutions,
including in the mandates of a number of United
Nations peace operations and in resolutions of the
Human Rights Council. Important initiatives, such as
the code of conduct regarding Security Council action
against genocide, crimes against humanity and war
crimes, the Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes
and Human Rights Up Front have supported efforts
to prevent atrocity crimes and continue to serve as
important tools for mainstreaming atrocity prevention
and strengthening prevention capacities

====================

The prevention of atrocities is at the core of each
of the three pillars of the responsibility to protect

====================

Member States should better utilize the entire United
Nations system to effectively prevent and respond to
their perpetration. As the 2018 report of the SecretaryGeneral on the Responsibility to Protect suggests,
we should make a concerted effort to continue to
report on progress towards the implementation of
the responsibility to protect and bring situations of
imminent risk of atrocity crimes to the attention of the
General Assembly, the Security Council and th Human
Rights Council, as needed. For example, the Human
Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is
well-placed to support preventive efforts. We encourage
Member States to better utilize the UPR processes as a
preventive mechanism

====================

This year we mark the seventieth anniversary of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which
was created in response to violent conflict in order
to prevent future violent conflicts. In addition to
embodying the international community’s commitment
to the promotion and protection of human rights for all
individuals around the world, the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and the treaties that derive from it
are, in the words of the Secretary General, the best
prevention tool we have

====================


The General Assembly should also play a more
active role in supporting States in their efforts to
carry out their primary responsibility to protect their
populations. The Security Council should consider
situations where there is potential for mass atrocities at
the earliest possible stage, including through utilizing
working methods such as situational awareness
briefings and Arria Formula meetings

====================

We also strongly emphasize the role of women in
the prevention of atrocity crimes, as they are crucial
for early warning and peacebuilding, promoting
cooperation and capacity-building and creating more
cohesive and inclusive societies. We should take
concrete steps to end all forms of discrimination on the
basis of gender and to empower women as agents of
atrocity prevention, including by ensuring that all girls
have equal access to quality education

====================

As recognized in the Secretary-General’s report,
we need to mobilize all the resources at our disposal and
broaden the constituency of actors engaged in atrocity
prevention. In that respect, we specifically welcome
recent efforts by the General Assembly and the Security
Council to recognize and promote the participation of
youth in conflict prevention and resolution

====================

Accountability for the perpetrators of atrocity
crimes is among the most effective ways of preventing
recurrence. States have the primary responsibility
to investigate and prosecute international crimes
committed within their jurisdiction, and national
accountability efforts should be encouraged and
supported, including by strengthening judicial
cooperation among States

====================

We urge States to comply with their international
legal obligations and thoroughly investigate and
prosecute persons responsible for genocide, crimes
against humanity, war crimes or other serious
violations of international law, as well as to strengthen
judicial cooperation with other States for that purpose

====================

International investigative mechanisms, including
fact-finding missions and commissions of inquiry,
can support efforts to promote accountability and
bring situations of concern to the attention of States

====================

Additionally, international courts and hybrid tribunals,
including the International Criminal Court, provide
complementary avenues in appropriate circumstances
to enable accountability

====================

We take this opportunity to reaffirm our support
for the United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention

and the Responsibility to Protect, and we encourage the
Secretary-General to appoint a Special Adviser on the
Responsibility to Protect. The Special Adviser and the
Joint Office have a key role in assisting Member States
in the operationalization of the responsibility to protect

====================

We reiterate the significance of the Convention
on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide as an effective international instrument
for the prevention and punishment of the crime of
genocide. To mark the seventieth anniversary of the
adoption of the Genocide Convention on 9 December,
the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide
launched an appeal for its universal ratification, which
is supported by the Secretary-General. We strongly
encourage States that have not yet ratified or acceded to
the Convention to consider doing so as a matter of high
priority and to ensure its implementation at the national
level. Ratifying and complying with the Convention is
an affirmation of the commitment to “never again”

====================

We recognize the important role national and
international civil society can play in supporting
the further advancement and implementation of the
responsibility to protect. In particular, we would like
to thank the Global Centre for the Responsibility to
Protect for its invaluable work as the secretariat of the
Group of Friends, both in New York and Geneva

====================

At a time when more than 68.5 million people are
displaced as a result of armed conflict, atrocities and
persecution worldwide, we hope that during this debate
we can collectively identify implementable strategies
that can effectively prevent atrocities and protect
populations around the world from atrocities

====================

The President: I now give the floor to the observer
of the European Union.
