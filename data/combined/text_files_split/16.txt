HRC39 Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect Statement
High-level panel discussion to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
13 September 2018

Mr President,
I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of members of the
Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect

====================

Seventy years ago, the UN General Assembly established the Convention
on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide through
Resolution 260 A III. The Convention not only provides a legal definition of
genocide, but also constitutes one of the first and most significant
practical attempts by the UN to address international crimes and human
rights. Under the Convention, States undertake to prevent and punish acts
of genocide, regardless of whether they have been committed in
peacetime or during armed conflict. The Rome Statute of the International
Criminal Court further affirms that the most serious crimes of international
concern, including genocide, must not go unpunished and that their
effective prosecution must be ensured

====================

Despite the celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the Genocide
Convention later this year, over the last seven decades acts of genocide
have still occurred. The 100 days of slaughter in Rwanda in 1994, killing
more than 800,000 men, women and children, and the massacre at
Srebrenica, both demonstrate the ongoing need to prevent and punish
genocide

====================

Despite efforts to learn from the past and better prevent mass atrocity
crimes, ongoing serious violations and abuses of international law
highlight the need to bridge the gap between words and deeds, and to
uphold our shared responsibilities

====================

It is clear that there is a growing body of evidence of terrible crimes
committed against the Yazidi in northern Iraq, four years after these
atrocious events took place. This August marked the first anniversary of
the 25 August ARSA attacks in Myanmar and
the horrific and
disproportionate response of the Myanmar security forces. According to
the HRC’s Independent International Fact Finding Mission, there is
sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of
senior members of the Tatmadaw/Burmese military in the Tatmadaw
chain of command, so that a competent court can determine their liability
for genocide in relation to the situation in Rakhine State

====================

Mr President,

One of the most significant efforts to transform the sentiment of “never
again” into meaningful action was the unanimous adoption of the principle
of the Responsibility to Protect, whereby states unanimously committed to
protect populations from genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity
and ethnic cleansing, as set out in the 2005 World Summit Outcome
Document. The primary responsibility for protecting a population from
genocide and other mass atrocities lies with that population’s
government. Where national authorities are manifestly failing to protect
their population from such atrocities, the international community has a
responsibility to act

====================

We strongly believe that the Human Rights Council and all Geneva-based
human rights mechanisms are particularly well suited to recognise the
early warning signs of genocide and other mass atrocity crimes. This
includes focusing on country-specific situations where States may be
unable or unwilling to protect their populations and establishing
monitoring and/or investigative mechanisms as well as offering technical
assistance, capacity building and access to special procedure mechanisms,
within their mandates. All of these measures are critical to achieve
effective and early action aimed at preventing genocide and other mass
atrocities

====================

In this regard, we wish to highlight the crucial role of the Special
Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparations and guarantees
of non-recurrence, whose work is an essential contribution to seek truth,
ensure accountability and promote reconciliation, all of which are essential
for the prevention of genocide and other mass atrocities

====================

We further wish to highlight the crucial role of the UN Office on Genocide
Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect, and applaud the Special
Adviser to the Secretary General on the Prevention of Genocide, Mr

====================

Adama Dieng, for his tireless efforts to promote and defend the principles
enshrined in the Genocide Convention. We therefore urge all member
states to continue and strengthen their cooperation with the Special
Advisor’s Office, as well as with all other relevant UN bodies. We would
also like to call for all member states to urge the UN Secretary-General to
progress the appointment of a new Special Adviser on the Responsibility
to Protect

====================

Mr President,
As was noted in Resolution 37/26 on the Prevention of Genocide from 6
April 2018, “further international cooperation is required to facilitate the
timely prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide”. In this
context, we call upon all member states to sign and ratify the Genocide
Convention and, where applicable, enact relevant national legislation

====================


Resolution 37/26 further reiterated the responsibility of each State to
protect its population from genocide through appropriate and necessary
means. Such means may include the establishment of national institutions
focusing on mass atrocity prevention and the appointment of national
Focal Points on the prevention of genocide, which are already engaging in
dialogue and the exchange of best practices on an international level. We
encourage Member States who have not done so to consider appointing
such an R2P Focal Point and help promote genocide prevention at the
national, regional and international level

====================

We also stress the importance of ending impunity for perpetrators of
genocide and mass atrocities. Accountability provides a glimpse of justice
for victims of atrocity crimes, and helps prevent their recurrence

====================

Therefore, we wish to call upon all member states to continue to
investigative and prosecute those responsible for grave breaches of
international law and, where applicable, cooperate with the International
Criminal Court

====================

Mr President,
Protecting populations from genocide, war crimes, crimes against
humanity and ethnic cleansing is our individual and collective
responsibility. The best way to uphold that responsibility and to honour
the Genocide Convention is by consistently holding perpetrators to
account and meaningfully preventing future atrocities

====================

Thank you

====================
