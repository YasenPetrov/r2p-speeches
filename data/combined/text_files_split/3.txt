Group of Friends of R2P Geneva
Statement on Item 2 - Annual report of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the
High Commissioner and the Secretary-General
10 September 2019
Mr. President,
I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of members of the Group of Friends of the
Responsibility to Protect (R2P)

====================

We would like to thank the High Commissioner Madame Bachelet and her Office for their tireless
endeavours in preventing the continuation of human rights violations, engaging with all
Governments in order to secure respect for all human rights and enhancing international
cooperation to protect human rights including through monitoring and reporting of gross human
rights violations and abuses around the world, in accordance with their mandates. We further
thank her for the oral update to the Council

====================

The work carried out by the High Commissioner, the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms
is vital to fulfilling the Responsibility to Protect populations from genocide, war crimes, crimes
against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Geneva-based human rights mechanisms play a
fundamental role in upholding our individual and shared commitment to mass atrocity
prevention

====================

Mr. President,
The High Commissionerâ€™s reports and regular updates on country specific situations are
particularly relevant in supporting international eff orts to address the risks of mass atrocity
crimes, since they help raise awareness and are capable of mobilizing effective preventive and
responsive action at an early stage. Further, OHCHR plays a crucial role in addressing factors
which facilitate systematic human rights violations and can, through the wider Geneva-system,
contribute to subsequent efforts of technical assistance and capacity building aimed at
strengthening domestic atrocity prevention

====================

Furthermore, we highlight the importance of special procedures mandate holders, the Universal
Periodic Review and other mechanisms under the auspices of the Human Rights Council in the
context of assisting States to fulfil their international obligations. States also have an individual
responsibility to protect their populations from mass atrocities and, where unable or unwilling to
do so, the responsibility lies with the international community to act through the United Nations

====================

Lastly, we would like to highlight the importance of strengthening coordination and streamlining
the United Nations system in the field of human rights to more effectively prevent gross human
rights violations

====================

Mr. President,
It is clear that the key to effective action in preventing mass atrocity crimes is through raising
awareness of situations at risk. We therefore urge the High Commissioner to continue to shed
light on systematic human rights violations and therefore mobilize support to take action

====================

Towards this end, we call upon the international community better utilize this knowledge in order
to act in a timely and decisive manner when early warning signs of possible atrocity situations
emerge

====================

Thank you

====================
