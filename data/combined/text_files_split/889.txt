As a State party to the
Convention against Torture, Viet Nam reaffirms its
commitment to preventing and countering acts of
torture and has continued to pursue international
cooperation in this regard

====================

As nations differ in approaches, a genuine spirit of
international cooperation lies in the principle of respect
for sovereign rights and mutual understanding. The
imposition of views of a group of Member States on
others cannot be called cooperation or consultation

====================

That rings true in the case of resolution 73/304, on
torture-free trade, which covers many complex issues,
such as capital punishment and common international
trade standards. We believe that extensive and thorough
discussion is required for such a resolution, rather
than the mere three informal meetings held during
the past few weeks. It is also regrettable that many
good proposals were presented during the informal
consultations to reflect the diverse views of Member
States and find common ground, but which were not
taken into account. Viet Nam could not therefore
support resolution 73/304 and abstained in the voting

====================

We would like to highlight the following points

====================

First, the inclusion of capital punishment in the
resolution is unacceptable. In no way should capital
punishment be linked with torture. Capital punishment
is a criminal justice issue that falls within the sovereign
rights of each country, and its application is restricted
to only the most serious crimes

====================

Secondly, further clarification is needed with
regard to the scope of the resolution and the definition
of goods in the context thereof. Such goods must not be
understood to include dual-use goods that are used for
the purpose of national security, defence or public order

====================

Thirdly, on the group of governmental experts that
the resolution aims to create, taking into account the
universal nature of the issue the group will deal with,
we urge that the establishment and work of the group
be undertaken in an inclusive manner and based on
consultation with the United Nations membership

====================


Last but not least, we had great concern about the
direct submission of this totally new resolution to the
General Assembly plenary without consultation with
such relevant bodies affiliated with the Assembly as
the Third Committee or the Human Rights Council

====================

Against that backdrop, we would like to refer to
resolution 51/241, entitled “Strengthening of the United
Nations system”

====================

“[a]s a general rule, agenda items that could
be considered in the Main Committees shall be
referred to the Main Committees rather than the
General Assembly in plenary meetings.”
We therefore call on delegations to follow closely the
working methods we have agreed upon.
