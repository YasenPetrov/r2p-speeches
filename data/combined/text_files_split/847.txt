The Czech
Republic aligns itself with the statements delivered on
behalf of the European Union and the Group of Friends
on the Responsibility to Protect

====================

As we already heard today, the responsibility
to protect is based on three mutually supporting and
non-sequential pillars: the responsibility of States
to protect their citizens, the shared responsibility of
the international community to provide States with
assistance in implementing that responsibility, and even
the taking of decisive action where all other efforts fail

====================


While a large part of our discussions is focused on the
third pillar, the essence of our efforts, as suggested by
the Secretary-General in his recent report (A/73/898),
should be focused on the first two pillars, which are
based on prevention and international cooperation. We
are convinced that the work starts at the national level
with ensuring the full and equal participation of all

====================

Whenever people are left voiceless, whenever
their voices are ignored or twisted, discontent and
grievances grow. That is why the Czech Republic, as
a member of the Human Rights Council, is a driving
force behind the resolution on equal participation in
political and public affairs. Furthermore, in his report,
the Secretary-General rightly stresses the need to
include women in early-warning as well as preventive
measures. In this context, a thorough implementation
of the women and peace and security agenda becomes
a matter of urgency

====================

The Human Rights Council is a body with a
particularly strong potential for effective early action
and an early-warning function. While the Universal
Periodic Review and treaty bodies play a crucial part
in assessing national risks and resilience, the special
procedures mandate-holders play an irreplaceable
role in early warning and the prevention of mass
atrocities. The Czech Republic supports the efforts to
strengthen the preventive role of the Council and its
efficiency, which we believe will further elevate its role
and credibility

====================

Last year marked the seventieth anniversary of the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide. We would like to urge all States
that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Convention
to do so. In the Czech Republic, we reflected the
Convention in our legislation, which actually provides
an even stronger level of protection from genocide by
also listing among the protected groups “class, or other
similar groups of people”

====================

We can all agree that impunity for the crime of
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity
encourages their reoccurrence. It is States that have
the primary responsibility to investigate and prosecute
crimes within their jurisdiction, and such national efforts
should be encouraged and assisted by all other Member
States. At the international level, the International
Criminal Court remains the most important institution
in the battle to end impunity for genocide, war crimes
and crimes against humanity. The Czech Republic

continues to support the International Criminal Court
and other international criminal tribunals in their work
and their role as a deterrent of atrocity crimes

====================

Finally, we would like to use this opportunity to
welcome the inclusion of the responsibility to protect
in the formal agenda of the seventy-third session of the
General Assembly and to voice our hope that during the
next session of General Assembly, the responsibility
to protect will finally receive the status of a standing
item on the agenda of the General Assembly, a status it
rightly deserves.
