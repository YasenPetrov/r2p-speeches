CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY

His Excellency, Mr. Ban Ki-moon;
Mr. President of the General Assembly;
Excellencies;
Ladies and Gentlemen;

11 years ago, world leaders met in this very city to negotiate and agree to what
were supposedly audacious decisions in areas of development, security,
human rights and UN reforms. The 2005 summit gave birth to the notion of the
“Responsibility to Protect” (R2P) which gave the global community the right to
intervene when national authorities fail in their foremost responsibilities to
protect their own people from genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes
and ethnic cleansing

====================

Today, the challenges related to protecting populations from barbaric crimes
remain despairingly great. Despite some headways made to prevent and
effectively respond to atrocity crimes, efforts by the global community remains
deplorably inadequate. We meet at a time where millions of people are crying
out for unprecedented protection and other humanitarian needs

====================

Mr. Chair, Vanuatu remains deeply concerned at the alarming and
unprecedented trend of forced displacement happening around the world
which has escalated to a global crisis. This global crisis would have been

avoided had the global community not failed to uphold the principles of the
responsibility to protect thereby preventing atrocity crimes escalating to levels
it reached in Syria, South Sudan, Yemen and Iraq. Perhaps the world was
waiting for the UN Security Council to take swift action and it should have

====================

Being a member of the UN Security Council is a responsibility as much as it is a
privilege. The UN Security Council must be swift to act when situations remain
at emerging risk to avoid full blown out atrocity crimes. The Council has a huge
role to play in protecting the world’s most vulnerable citizens in dire severe
situations, especially women and children. When fronted with situations of
mass atrocity crimes, the UN Security Council should learn to put their
differences including their political interests aside for the sake of humanity

====================

Mr. Chair, enforcement of international human rights and international
humanitarian systems remain weak. That is why Vanuatu is fully supportive of
the International Criminal Court which is the most important international
institution in the forefront in the fight to end impunity for mass atrocity
crimes. Making those responsible for mass atrocity crimes accountable and
threatened by International Criminal Court prosecutions for their actions is one
of the most effective ways to prevent recurrence and create deterrence. The
international community must also redouble efforts to engage in preventative
diplomacy which if employed early, has proven to be an effective tool in
preventing ongoing atrocities from escalating

====================

Mr. Chair, Vanuatu has been contributing its own members of the police force
to active Peacekeeping duties since 2000. Vanuatu wishes to announce our
endorsement of the Kigali Principles on the Protection of Civilians, which are
significant especially as they address some of the weaknesses that undermine
the effectiveness of peacekeepers in times of unstable situations. We call for

their swift implementation so that peacekeepers can be better prepared to
play a role in also preventing mass atrocity crimes, and we encourage all UN
Member States to join us in endorsing the Principles

====================

Mr Chair, Vanuatu remains committed to the principles of the Responsibility to
Protect and calls for the full implementation of all three pillars of the norm

====================

Vanuatu, like many other states, views the three pillars as mutually supporting
and non-sequential. Vanuatu supports any meaningful investment in the
prevention of atrocity crimes

====================

Mr. Chair, Vanuatu highly commends the current UN Secretary General in
championing the principles of the Responsibility to Protect. Vanuatu fully
supports the call made by the UN Secretary General for all UN member states
to rededicate and deepen their commitment towards the principles of R2P
through a new General Assembly resolution. Vanuatu sincerely hopes that the
incoming UN Secretary General will continue to develop the Human Rights Up
Front Initiative and will share the same passion as the current Secretary
General in giving precedence to R2P in order to prevent future mass atrocities

====================

Conclusion
Mr. Chair, it is one thing to build consensus around the notion of the
responsibility to protect and it is another to translate the principle from words
into action. We all have a responsibility to protect the global population from
atrocity crimes especially at times where national authorities fail in their
primary duties to protect their own people. The charter of the United Nations
constantly reminds us that lives irrespective of race, ethnicity or religion
matters

====================

I thank you

====================
