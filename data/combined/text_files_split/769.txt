(spoke in Chinese):
The Chinese delegation listened carefully to the
presentation delivered by Secretary-General Guterres
and has taken note of his report on the issue of the
responsibility to protect (A/72/884). We would like to
make the following observations

====================

First, we must uphold the principle that the
Governments of all countries have the primary
responsibility to protect their citizens, along with
the principle of the ownership of Member States

====================

The responsibility to protect the people ultimately
rests with each Government, consistent with the
principle of sovereignty. When addressing crises, the
international community should therefore fully respect
the sovereignty of the countries concerned, abide by the
purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations and uphold the principles of sovereign equality
and non-interference in internal affairs

====================

protect civilians. The international community should
give priority to dialogue, consultation, negotiation,
mediation, good offices and other peaceful means for
solving problems. The use of force in enforcement
measures and the authorization to use force should be
considered only when all peaceful measures have been
exhausted. It should also be in line with the provisions
of the Charter of the United Nations. Military action
taken by the international community to protect
civilians must be authorized by the Security Council
with strict conditions attached and explicit methods
of implementation

====================

Based on respect for the leadership of the countries
concerned, the international community should provide
constructive assistance when necessary. In the current
context, all parties should foster the concept of a
common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable
security and strive to build a community for the shared
future of humankind. This is the fundamental longterm approach to protecting the peoples of all countries

====================

Now that Member States are paying heightened
attention to the issue of the responsibility to protect, we
hope that the discussions held in the General Assembly
will help them to build consensus and refrain from
imposing controversial initiatives

====================

Secondly, we must faithfully implement the 2005
World Summit Outcome document, which states that
the application of the responsibility to protect is strictly
restricted to genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity. This formulation is
a balanced one and a compromise negotiated by all
countries, and all parties should therefore refrain
from expanding or arbitrarily interpreting, distorting
or abusing it. The principle of leadership by Member
States should be upheld in the discussion of the concept
of the responsibility to protect

====================

Thirdly, prevention and increasing preventive
diplomacy efforts are important. China notes that the
Secretary-Generalâ€™s report proposes a series of measures
regarding early warning and early action, such as
strengthening the capacity-building of Member States,
solving problems by political means and fully leveraging
the roles of United Nations agencies and regional and
subregional organizations. China appreciates this
reflection of a focus on prevention

====================

In the light of their circumstances, the countries
concerned should strengthen prevention efforts by
identifying their own weaknesses and the possible
risks they face and try to address the root causes of the
conflict, with a view to addressing both the symptoms
and sources of the problem

====================

Fourthly, we must exercise caution when using
force and should strive to use non-military measures to
