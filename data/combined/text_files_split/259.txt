Nicaragua’s Statement at the 2016 UN General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion,
From Commitment to Implementation: Ten Years of Responsibility to Protect
[Transcribed]
26 February 2016
Thank you, Mr. Moderator

====================

Our delegation would like to state that the language of the moderator has been lacking in
respect to the sovereign positions of member states. In accordance with the United Nations
Charter, member states are the same, large or small. We are appalled at that attitude by a
secretariat official; this attitude undermines the sovereign right of states to express themselves
freely at the United Nations

====================

The Responsibility to Protect is not accepted, nor supported, by all members of the United
Nations, including Nicaragua. Much less can we accept other elements of this idea, as it could
be extremely counterproductive and harmful for states since protection is the responsibility of
each state. While the intention is laudable, the implementation has been the opposite of those
intentions. The United Nations Charter does not include any type of reference to a right to
humanitarian interference, but it does contemplate the issues of sovereignty and
noninterference in the internal affairs of states

====================

From 2013, we have witnessed how by means of manipulating topics like this one,
interventionism and violations of sovereignty have disintegrated states and have caused great
suffering for populations, including the crisis today of refugees. I would like to reiterate that at no
time there has been a real dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect and we do not believe in
adopting a topic on which there is no agreement. In the words of our President Daniel Ortega,
“Our organizations must respond to the challenges of our time with measures and actions that
reflect the supreme interests of the people: respect, the inviolability of sovereignty, the
recognition of patrimonial natural resources, the promotion of security, justice, and peace
