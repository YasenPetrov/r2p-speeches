Thank you, Mr. President,
First of all, Germany would like to thank the Special Advisers, Mr. Adama
Dieng and Mr. Ivan Šimonović, for their committed efforts to strengthen
prevention and the responsibility to protect. Furthermore we would like
to thank the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr

====================

Zeid al-Hussein, for maintaining an early warning mechanism by
continuously bringing critical country situations to our attention

====================

The fact that genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and ethnic
cleansing not only persist but are actually on the rise, constitutes a stark
reminder of the urgent need to find solutions to prevent these crimes and
thereby implement the responsibility to protect. Therefore we welcome
today’s opportunity to discuss the first report of the Secretary-General,
Mr. António Guterres, on “Accountability for prevention”

====================

In his report the Secretary General points out the importance of
strengthening accountability for the implementation of R2P. Germany
supports the views expressed here and would like to share best
practices in relation to two aspects of this report in order to
operationalize the debate on R2P:
1. As mentioned in the report, it is essential that States have an accurate
understanding of the sources of potential domestic risks. This risk
assessment stemming from pillar 1 of R2P is based on the principle that
no country is immune from atrocity risks. Germany has seen a rise in
hate speech on social media. Hate speech carries the risk of triggering
violence, even genocidal violence in worst-case scenarios. To counter
hate speech and to fulfil our obligation under pillar 1, we drafted a law
which sets out binding standards for the way operators of social
networks deal with complaints and obliges them to delete criminal
content

====================

2. The report emphasizes the importance of ensuring accountability for
past and present atrocity crimes in order to prevent their recurrence. At
the national level, Germany contributes to the fight against impunity by
investigating war crimes and crimes against humanity under the principle
of universal jurisdiction and on the basis of our International Criminal
Code. Furthermore, since 2011, the Federal Public Prosecutor General
has started investigations with regards to war crimes and crimes against
1

humanity in Syria and Iraq. These files serve primarily to secure
evidence for national or international criminal proceedings at a later
stage. But these files have also already led to various investigations into
and charges against specific individuals, who were prosecuted for
concrete war crimes in both Syria and Iraq. Germany has also pledged 1
Million Euros of voluntary funding in support of the International, Impartial
and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) of the General Assembly in order to
further improve the gathering of evidence on atrocities being committed
in Syria. We urge all UN member states to cooperate fully with the IIIM
and facilitate its work

====================

Furthermore, Germany very much welcomes the initiative to include the
implementation of the Responsibility to Protect in the formal agenda of
the General Assembly

====================

Germany also aligns itself with the statement delivered by the European
Union
