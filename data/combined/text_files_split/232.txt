The Philippines’ Statement at the 2016 UN General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion,
From Commitment to Implementation: Ten Years of Responsibility to Protect
[Transcribed]
26 February 2016
Thank you, Mr. Chair

====================

I asked for the floor to share with the meeting today briefly the outcome of the second
international meeting of the Global Action Against Mass Atrocity Crimes, or GAAMAC, which the
Philippines and Switzerland co­hosted in Manila last February. The meeting focused on how to
strengthen national architectures in the prevention of mass atrocity crimes. Your good self, Mr

====================

Special Advisor, joined more than 200 delegates and experts to share their experiences and to
contribute in an inclusive, multi­stakeholder involvement in preventing atrocity crimes and
strengthening the capacities and strategies of states, international buddies, and
non­governmental organizations to deter such crimes

====================

Regional plans of action on practical tools and approaches to combat the threat of mass atrocity
crimes were also discussed at GAAMAC 2. The GAAMAC 2 also specifically discussed the
importance of atrocity prevention education curriculum, and promoting a culture of tolerance and
accountability, the Philippine early warning mechanisms, compiling good practices on
countering hate speech, and promoting inclusivity, and making information and technology tools
including the use of social media available for atrocity prevention at the local community and
grassroots level

====================

The participants of GAAMAC 2 agreed that GAAMAC has great potential to raise awareness,
support policy formulation, and strengthen capacities. Details on the outcome of GAAMAC 2 are
posted on the GAAMAC website. Mr. Chair, while it is true that atrocity crimes continue to occur
in some parts of the world, it is also true that the determined efforts of the global community to
prevent and end mass atrocity crimes are even more remarkable. Thank you, Mr. Chair
