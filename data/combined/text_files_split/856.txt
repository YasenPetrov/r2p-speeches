I have
the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union
(EU) and its 28 member States. The candidate countries
the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro and
Albania, as well as Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova
and Georgia, align themselves with this statement

====================

At the World Summit 14 years ago, all States
Members of the United Nations endorsed the principle
of a shared responsibility to protect populations from
genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and
war crimes. Since 2005, the European Union has been
a staunch supporter of the responsibility to protect. We
warmly welcome the inclusion of a dedicated debate on
this issue in the formal agenda of the General Assembly
again this year. We believe that it reflects the topic’s
importance and allows us to have a full exchange on the
current state of affairs in atrocity prevention. We thank
Secretary-General António Guterres for his report
entitled “Responsibility to protect: lessons learned for
prevention” (A/73/898)

====================

There have been important developments since last
year’s debate. We warmly welcome the appointment
of Ms. Karen Smith as the new Special Adviser of the
Secretary-General on the Responsibility to Protect, as
well as the active role that she has played since taking
up her position. We thank Mr. Adama Dieng, Special
Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention
of Genocide, for his leadership in the development of
the United Nations strategy and plan of action on hate
speech, which was launched very recently

====================

In his report on the responsibility to protect,
the Secretary-General rightly concludes that, while
States have the primary responsibility to protect their
populations, more needs to be done at the international
level. We must make greater efforts to reduce the risk
of atrocity crimes and respond promptly to evidence of

their imminent commission. International and regional
organizations have a unique role to play in preventing
and responding to mass atrocities. As highlighted in
the Secretary-General’s report, the European Union
recently co-hosted, with the Global Centre for the
Responsibility to Protect, the ninth annual meeting
of the Global Network of Responsibility to Protect
Focal Points. This year’s meeting had an explicit
focus on the specific role that regional organizations
can play in the promotion and implementation of the
responsibility to protect. It brought together a crossregional group of senior Government officials from
more than 45 countries, as well as representatives of the
United Nations, the Organization of American States,
the African Union, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe

====================


humanitarian law. A robust human rights culture within
the United Nations system is crucial to fulfilling our
responsibility to protect

====================


As the first regional organization to formally appoint
a responsibility to protect focal point, the European
Union warmly welcomes the recent appointment of a
focal point for the Organization of American States

====================

We strongly encourage other regional organizations, as
well as Member States, to do exactly the same, namely,
appoint focal points that will follow the issue of the
responsibility to protect as closely as possible

====================


We must continue to promote accountability for
atrocity crimes. The European Union and its member
States remain committed to the efforts at the national
and international levels to end impunity for the crime
of genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity
and war crimes. We reiterate our firm support to the
international criminal justice system and its institutions

====================

International courts and hybrid tribunals can play an
important role where States are unwilling or genuinely
unable to do so. We actively promote the universality
of the Rome Statute and, through our support for the
International Criminal Court, we foster capacities for
accountability and reconciliation, which we all know
are key elements for non-recurrence. We encourage the
Security Council to consider carefully the possibility
offered by the Rome Statute to refer situations to the
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court

====================


It is also vital that the Security Council use
available tools in the exercise of its responsibility to
protect populations from mass atrocities. We welcome
the Arria Formula meeting on raising the effectiveness
of atrocity crimes prevention convened by Poland — a
State member of the European Union — last December

====================

Participants at the meeting highlighted some practical
actions on atrocity prevention that could be taken by
the Security Council. In that respect, we acknowledge
and welcome the initiatives aimed at ensuring that the
Security Council is able to effectively prevent or put
an end to situations involving the commission of mass
atrocities, including the Accountability, Coherence and
Transparency group code of conduct, and the initiative
on the suspension of the veto in cases of mass atrocities
presented by France and Mexico

====================

The Human Rights Council, human rights treaty
bodies at large and mechanisms involved must be
further mobilized in the prevention of atrocities

====================

Their interaction with the Security Council could be
strengthened to better inform the latter about situations
that may lead to atrocity crimes. The Human Rights
Up Front initiative also has an important role to
play in enhancing system-wide capacity to prevent
mass violations of human rights and international

The European Union supports the operationalization
of the concept of the responsibility to protect through
an integrated approach, including diplomatic support at
the bilateral and multilateral levels, transitional justice
and accountability, human rights, conflict prevention
and mediation, as well as development assistance and
humanitarian aid. Last year we launched a new EU
toolkit on the responsibility to protect and atrocity
prevention — an instrument that offers practical guidance
on atrocity prevention to our delegations, missions and
operations. We are certainly willing and able to share
that toolkit with the international community

====================


The responsibility to protect is not only about
international responses to domestic crises, but very
much also about domestic prevention of home-grown
risks. The European Union’s framework decision on
combating racism and xenophobia criminalizes public
incitement to violence or hatred directed against a
group of persons or a member of such a group defined
by reference to race, colour, religion, descent or
national or ethnic origin. As defined in the framework
decision, hate speech is a criminal offence, including
when it occurs online. The European Union, its member
States, social media companies and other platforms
share a collective responsibility to ensure that the
Internet does not become a safe haven for incitement to
violence and hatred, while at the same time promoting
and facilitating freedom of expression online

====================


In conclusion, there are obviously no easy
solutions. But the Secretary-General’s report rightly
calls for decisive early action towards prevention in
order to close the gap between our stated commitment
to the responsibility to protect and the daily experience
of vulnerable populations around the world. To close
that gap, we must ensure that the responsibility to
protect is operationalized and implemented in practice

====================

The European Union is committed to working with all
stakeholders to help make that a reality. We once again
welcome this debate and encourage further dialogue
in the General Assembly as we continue to work with
our international partners to fulfil the responsibility to
protect that we embraced back in 2005.
