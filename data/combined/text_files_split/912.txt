In 2005, we all agreed
that something must be done in order to protect
populations from genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes
against humanity and war crimes. However, despite
that commitment, thousands of people are still victims
of atrocities committed by their own Governments,
the very same Governments that are responsible for
their protection. Malta welcomes the inclusion of the
responsibility to protect on the formal agenda of the
General Assembly and hopes that these discussions will
allow us to continue to build on what has been achieved
so far. We also welcome the appointment of Ms. Karen
Smith as the new Special Adviser to the SecretaryGeneral on the Responsibility to Protect and thank
Mr. Adama Dieng for his work as Special Adviser to
the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide

====================

Malta fully aligns itself with the statement
delivered earlier today by the observer of the European
Union (see A/73/PV.93) and would like to make a few
comments in its national capacity

====================

In recent years we have seen reports of attacks
on schools, medical facilities, civilian infrastructure
and the use of chemical weapons. Such actions are

completely unacceptable and constitute a serious
violation of international law and international
humanitarian law. As we have seen far too often
throughout history, the effects of war loom long after
the fighting has ended. It can take years to rebuild
infrastructure; it can take decades for the environment
to regenerate; and it can take generations for wounds
that result from the deliberate targeting of ethnic groups
to heal. Ensuring accountability for atrocity crimes is
of fundamental importance

====================

Every year, thousands of people in different parts
of the world are forced to leave their homes and embark
on dangerous journeys in the hope of finding normality
and dignity. It is our duty to help and protect people who
feel the need to undertake such journeys in the hope of
finding a peaceful and secure place for their families

====================

However, in doing so, we cannot forget the root causes
that are forcing them to take such drastic action or the
social and economic strain that forced displacement can
have on regional stability and international security

====================

In his report (A/73/898), the Secretary-General
underlines the importance of having effective early
warning and early action systems, while a recent
World Bank report shows that for every dollar spent on
prevention, up to $7 can be saved in the long term. Civil
society, regional and subregional organizations have a
crucial role to play in that regard and closer cooperation
with the United Nations can help to identify risks at a
much earlier stage

====================

To ensure that existing tools for action are not
encumbered with bureaucracy and hindered by rhetoric,
a more proactive approach is warranted. While States
have the fundamental responsibility for protecting their
own citizens, the international community cannot afford
to look the other way when faced with genocide, ethnic
cleansing, crimes against humanity and war crimes. In
failing to show a determined and united front, we will
fail not only our forefathers, who strived to ensure that
we did not relive the atrocities that they had to witness,
but also future generations, who will wonder how we
managed to say so much, yet stand so still when faced
with such horrific events.
