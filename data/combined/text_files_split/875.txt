Let me first
thank the Secretary-General for his briefing this
morning and for his comprehensive report (A/72/884)

====================

I would also like to align myself with the statement
made earlier by the observer of the European Union and
with the joint statement of the Group of Friends of the
Responsibility to Protect, as delivered by one of the two
co-Chairs, our colleague from Qatar

====================

I would also like to thank Australia and Ghana for
their leadership and hard work, which is the reason
we can have this debate today, and Italy for taking
over the co-chairship of the Group of Friends of the
Responsibility to Protect this year, in the light of our
2017-2018 split term on the Security Council

====================

I will focus on three main points, which have
also guided our work in the Security Council this
year — first, prevention; secondly, peacekeeping and
the protection of civilians; and thirdly, accountability

====================

First, preventing mass atrocity crimes is the core
aim of the responsibility to protect. In that regard,
early action remains one of the main challenges. When
Governments call upon the international community to
assist them, we should heed that call at the very early
stages. We believe that mediators can play a crucial
role in addressing and reconciling the interests of
different actors. In that context, mediators could also
focus on root causes of grievances. That also means
listening to young people, whose desire to participate
in decision-making over their own future is, of course,
legitimate. If we really want mediation to be successful,
we must ensure that the spoilers of peace processes
are held accountable, for example, through targeted
sanctions. The draft manual for responsibility-toprotect focal points, drafted by the Global Centre for
the Responsibility to Protect, is a useful instrument
to collect all the lessons learned and best practices,
including in the domain of mediation

====================

That brings me to my second point, peacekeeping
and the protection of civilians. Much has been achieved
in the area of the protection of civilians through peace
operations. However, we should not look away from the
dark pages of our history. We in the Netherlands know
that all too well. Those dark pages give us an extra
historical responsibility to help prevent mass atrocities

====================

We have a responsibility to remember, as our colleague
from Ghana said. We are therefore committed to
learning from the past, so improving United Nations
peace operations remains one of our priorities. We
fully support the Secretary-General’s efforts in that
regard, and we commend his Action for Peacekeeping
initiative, launched in the Security Council during our
March presidency (see S/PV.8218)

====================

Indeed, peacekeeping is one of the most concrete
tools at our disposal in protecting civilians and laying a
foundation for a safer environment. In that connection,
let me recall the importance of the Kigali Principles on
the Protection of Civilians in improving peacekeeping
operations. We call on States that have not yet done so
to endorse them

====================

The Security Council has demonstrated that other
initiatives can also help to ensure that the protection of
civilians and other issues related to the responsibility to
protect remain high on its agenda. In that regard, I would
like to the Council’s recent adoption of resolution 2417
(2018), on banning starvation as a method of warfare,
which was a Dutch initiative

====================

My third and last point is the importance of
accountability. When national judicial systems fail
to ensure accountability for perpetrators of the most
serious crimes, we should make use of the various
instruments at our disposal, and the International
Criminal Court constitutes the most appropriate path

====================

This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the Rome
Statute. We reiterate the importance of the universal
ratification of the Statute by Member States

====================

If paths to justice remain blocked, we must
not waver in our efforts. A good example is the
International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism
to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of
Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes
under International Law Committed in the Syrian Arab
Republic since March 2011, which we adopted in this
Hall when the Security Council was blocked by the use
of the veto by one of its permanent members. Another
example is sanctions, which play an important role in
ensuring a culture of accountability. Also, in our view,
sanctions can have a preventive and deterrent effect in
averting the escalation of serious rights violations and
atrocity crimes, exemplified by the sanctions on human
traffickers recently imposed by the Security Council

====================

The principle of the responsibility to protect
is crucial in preventing mass atrocity crimes and
ensuring sustainable peace. All those instruments and
initiatives show that when it comes to the responsibility
to protect, the international community is more united
than it sometimes seems. However, in order to realize
effective international action in situations where action
is called for, we must do more. Ongoing dialogue
among States in the relevant international forums is
key. Here in the General Assembly, the parliament of
the world, we can do so by making the responsibility
to protect a standing agenda item. This meeting, the
first of its kind since 2009, confirms our collective
belief that implementing the responsibility to protect is
more needed than ever today. May the responsibility to
remember reinforce our collective will to prevent mass
atrocities and strengthen accountability.
