(spoke in
French): Belgium associates itself with the statement

made by the observer of the European Union, as well as
that made by the representative of Qatar on behalf of the
Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect (see
A/72/PV.99). I would now like to make a few comments
in my national capacity

====================

Belgium welcomes the holding of this formal debate
on the responsibility to protect, the first in almost 10
years. During the 2005 World Summit, all Heads of
State and Government of Member States agreed to
protect their peoples from the crime of genocide, war
crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity

====================

They also decided to take action in order to uphold
that responsibility. At a time when the victims of mass
atrocities continue to number in the thousands, it is more
than ever our duty not to forget those commitments

====================

This meeting and our discussions today are certainly
a step in that direction. In 2005, our representatives
also stressed that the General Assembly should
continue to consider the responsibility to protect and its
implications. I would also like to take this opportunity
to sincerely thank Australia and Ghana for proposing
almost a year ago now that this item be included on the
Assembly’s agenda during the current session

====================

We are obviously aware of the differences in
approach to the practical implementation of the
responsibility to protect. That pertains in particular
the second and third pillars of the concept, which are
an integral part of the commitments we have made

====================

However, it is precisely the fact that the approaches
differ that should encourage us to maintain a continuing
dialogue on the subject. That is why Belgium fully
supports the proposal already made by other delegations
that the issue of the responsibility to protect be included
as a permanent item on the agenda of the Assembly

====================

I would like to welcome the Secretary-General’s
latest report on the responsibility to protect (A/72/884)

====================

The emphasis on prevention and the primary
responsibility of States for protecting people from
atrocity crimes is paramount. State sovereignty is not
an obstacle to the responsibility to protect. On the
contrary, they are two mutually reinforcing concepts

====================

As the Secretary-General underscored in his report,
the United Nations system already has many tools at its
disposal to identify early-warning signs of situations
that could lead to atrocity crimes. I am thinking in
particular of the special procedures established by
the Human Rights Council, but also of the Office on
Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect

====================


Early-warning systems could include, for example,
regular meetings at which the Special Advisers of
the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide
and the Responsibility to Protect could present the
information they collect to the Security Council
and other relevant United Nations bodies and make
recommendations for concrete action. In any case,
the role of the Special Adviser on the Responsibility
to Protect is crucial, which is why Belgium urges the
Secretary-General to appoint a successor as soon as
possible to Mr. Šimonović, whose outstanding work
we commend

====================

While essential, prevention is unfortunately not
enough. In that regard, I would again refer to the 2005
World Summit Outcome document (resolution 60/1). The
World Summit participants stated at the time that when
States are unable to fulfil their responsibility to protect
their people or when a country’s national authorities have
clearly failed to protect their people, the international
community must take action. More specifically, at the
Summit the Member States highlighted the role that
the Security Council could play in certain cases. In
that regard, Belgium believes that the Council should
ensure that the protection of civilians is given priority
in the mandates of peacekeeping operations. In the
same spirit, the aspects related to the rule of law in
the mandates of political and peacekeeping missions
should also be strengthened and systematized, taking
into account the specific situations of each mission

====================

Combating impunity must also be a priority. That
responsibility falls first and foremost to each State. It
means that they have an obligation to prosecute the
perpetrators of the most serious crimes, wherever they
may be, in order to ensure that they do not escape justice

====================

States that have not yet ratified the most recent version
of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
should do so. However, the Security Council must also
strengthen its support to national judicial procedures
and hybrid mechanisms, as well as the International
Criminal Court, particularly with regard to the situations
it has referred to it. In view of the Council’s failure to
act, we also welcome the role played by the General
Assembly in creating the International, Impartial and
Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation
and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most
Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in
the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011. Finally,
when mass atrocities occur, the Security Council must
not allow disagreements among its permanent members

to result in inaction. Its credibility as a key actor in
maintaining international peace and security is at
stake. That is why Belgium supports the initiative of
France and Mexico to regulate the right of the veto in
the event of atrocity crimes, and why we also support
the code of conduct of the Accountability, Coherence
and Transparency group

====================

In conclusion, the commitments we made in
2005 with regard to the responsibility to protect are
ambitious. In the past few years, the annual reports
of the Secretary-General, several General Assembly
and Security Council resolutions, the work of the
Special Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide and
the Responsibility to Protect, the tools and instruments
developed at the national and regional levels and the
activities of many civil-society organizations have all
contributed to a better understanding of how we can
implement that responsibility. It is time to begin a new
chapter and take action so that we can avoid continually
mourning new tragedies

====================

The Acting President: The representative of India
has asked to speak in exercise of the right of reply. I

would like to remind members that statements in the
exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes
for the first intervention and five minutes for the second,
and should be made by delegations from their seats.
