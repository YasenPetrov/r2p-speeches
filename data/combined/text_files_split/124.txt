Special Envoy for
Syria, Ramzy Ezzeldin
Ramzy, following
meeting with Syrian
Deputy Foreign
Minister Fayssal
Mekdad

Both Eastern Ghouta and Idlib are designated de-escalation areas under the Astana
process and should therefore be places where civilians should expect a minimum level
of safety. However, since mid-November 2017, the estimated 393,000 people in Eastern
Ghouta have been subjected to airstrikes, shelling and bombardment on an almost daily
basis by government forces and their allies. These people are living under extreme
conditions as a result of a siege of the area by the Syrian Government, with some facing
severe food shortages and malnutrition. The Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights (OHCHR) has confirmed at least 85 civilian deaths in Eastern Ghouta
between 31 December 2017 and 10 January 2018, of whom at least 30 were children

====================

Rockets fired by armed opposition groups in Eastern Ghouta into residential areas of
Damascus have reportedly further aggravated the situation

====================

In southern Idlib and northern rural Hama, there has been an escalation in fighting since
December 2017 between government forces and their allies, and the Hay’at Tahrir Al-

====================

The fighting has resulted in numerous civilian deaths and the displacement of more
than 200,000 civilians in recent weeks. On 8 December 2017, for example, airstrikes hit
an IDP camp in Khwin village, south of Idlib, killing three children and their mother,
according to OHCHR reports. On 17 December ten civilians, six women and four
children, were reportedly killed in Khan Shaykun in southern Idlib bordering Hama by
airstrikes and on 20 December 18 civilians, including seven women and five children,
were killed in Maar Shurin town, south of Idlib. At least four attacks on health care
facilities and two attacks on education facilities have also been reported between 3 and
10 January 2018

====================

A continued escalation in hostilities will worsen the situation for civilians. An estimated
half of the estimated two million people in Idlib governate have taken refuge there after
fleeing or being relocated as a result of violence in other areas of the country, making
them even more vulnerable

====================

Attacks that are indiscriminate or directly target civilians or civilian objects are a
violation of fundamental principles of international humanitarian law. All actors involved
in the conflict in Syria have an obligation to ensure that these fundamental principles
are respected. The level of violence and suffering inflicted on the Syrian people after
almost seven years of conflict should not be tolerated. More than six million people
have been internally displaced by the conflict, many displaced multiple times, and more
than five million Syrians have sought refuge in other countries. It is estimated that more
than half of the country’s basic infrastructure is damaged or destroyed and over 13
million people are in need of humanitarian assistance

====================

“We cannot stand by silently in the face of indiscriminate violence and violations of
international human rights and humanitarian law. All the parties to the Syrian conflict,
as well as the international community, have a responsibility to protect civilians from
atrocity crimes. We urge all stakeholders, including the Security Council, to condemn
this violence, and we urge the parties to the conflict to ensure that basic principles of
humanitarian law are protected, in particular with regards to proportionality and
distinction
