(spoke in French):
Belgium associates itself with the statements
made by the observer of the European Union and
by the representative of Denmark on behalf of the
Group of Friends on the Responsibility to Protect
(see A/73/PV.93)

====================


We must clearly state that the direct support
mentioned in the report from the international
community, especially the United Nations, to civil
society organizations in States without the prior
knowledge of or coordination with their Governments,
notwithstanding the important role of those
organizations in the area of prevention, is very dangerous

Belgium welcomes the convening of this formal
debate on the responsibility to protect. Last year, for the
first plenary debate in almost 10 years, many Member
States took the floor. The exchanges were very useful,
first, to identify the various tools at our disposal to
specifically implement the responsibility to protect at
the national and international levels and, secondly, to

better understand the differences in approach that can
sometimes exist among us on this issue

====================


last May, and we encourage those States and regional
organizations that have yet to do so to join this network

====================


Allow me to welcome the presence today of
Ms. Karen Smith, the new Special Adviser to the
Secretary-General on the Responsibility to Protect

====================

She can count on Belgiumâ€™s full support. We welcome
the fact that, since the beginning of her term, she has
conducted extensive consultations, in particular at
the regional level, with all stakeholders on this issue

====================

We recognize that some trust may have been eroded
over time. However, we are also convinced that we
cannot remain silent if there is a risk of atrocities

====================

This conceptual debate should not prevent us from
working to operationalize the concept of responsibility
to protect

====================


Beyond the primary role to be played by States,
the report also recalled the commitment made in
2005 under which the international community must
intervene when national authorities are not able to fulfil
their responsibility to protect, or when they are clearly
not protecting their peoples

====================


The goal is first and foremost to respect the
commitments that we all made during the 2005 World
Summit. These cannot remain just wishful thinking
when each day peoples continue to be the victims of
atrocity crimes. This is why we must continue this
dialogue and adopt concrete measures when required

====================

It is in this spirit that this year my country calls once
again for the topic of the responsibility to protect to be
permanently inscribed on the agenda of the Assembly

====================

I wish to commend the most recent report of the
Secretary-General on the responsibility to protect
(A/73/898). The focus on the primary responsibility
of States to protect their peoples is timely and should,
we hope, eliminate any ambiguity on the subject. State
sovereignty is indeed no obstacle to the responsibility
to protect. On the contrary, these are two mutually
reinforcing concepts. The report thus rightly stresses
areas of action in which States have a key role to play

====================

In that respect, the review of the progress made
on Sustainable Development Goal 16 during the next
session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable
Development, which will begin in a few days, will offer
an excellent opportunity for States to share their best
practices and experiences in the promotion of peaceful
and inclusive societies by ensuring access for all to
justice and by establishing effective, responsible and
open institutions at all levels

====================

At the national level, the contributions of focal
points on R2P and the support provided by regional
organizations and civil society in building capacities
to prevent mass atrocities are undeniable. Belgium
has actively participated in the ninth meeting of focal
points organized by the European Union in Brussels

As a member of the Security Council since
1 January, Belgium is particularly focused on the
Council using the many tools at its disposal to act, both
formally and informally, in the prevention of atrocities

====================

As concerns early-warning systems, we also are of the
view that the Security Council must be periodically
informed, in an independent matter, about situations
that could lead to atrocity crimes. We are convinced
that the Special Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide
and the Responsibility to Protect also can bring added
value on board in this context

====================

We also call for better coordination between
the deliberations of and the decisions taken by the
Security Council in New York and the United Nations
mechanisms and bodies in Geneva, including the High
Commissioner and the Human Rights Council. While
each has a specific mandate and works in respect of the
purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations, their functional interaction must be enhanced
so as to ramp up the institutional capacity of the United
Nations in the area of conflict prevention

====================

We must recognize that human rights violations
can contribute to, or be at the root of, a conflict, as
reflected in the approach that is based on the three
pillars. We must also work to prevent the commission of
new atrocity crimes. While the fight against impunity
is first and foremost the responsibility of each State, the
Security Council must bolster its support for national
legal procedures and hybrid mechanisms, as well as for
the International Criminal Court, in particular for those
cases that it referred to the Court

====================

We pay tribute to the role played by the General
Assembly in the creation of the International,
Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the
Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible
for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law
Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March
2011, as well as by the Human Rights Council in the
establishment of the independent international fact-

finding mission on Myanmar, following the inaction of
the Council in those cases

====================

Finally, when the Council establishes that a
situation involving mass atrocities exists, it must not
let disagreements between its permanent members lead
to inaction. That is why Belgium supports the FrenchMexican initiative to restrict the right to veto in cases of
atrocity crimes and has adhered to the Accountability,
Coherence and Transparency group code of conduct

====================

We are pleased to see the level of support for these
complementary initiatives continue to grow; it is a sign
that the Council can no longer ignore

====================

We have made undeniable progress since 2005,
but it remains insufficient. Today Belgium calls on
all States Members of the United Nations to overcome
their differences and to individually and collectively
implement our responsibility to protect.
