I thank
the President for convening the first formal General
Assembly debate in nine years on the responsibility
to protect. The United Arab Emirates welcomes the
renewed focus on an important concept in our global
foreign-policy toolkit. Today’s reinvigoration of the
discussion of the responsibility to protect in the current
global context is very timely. The United Arab Emirates
believes that a better understanding of the responsibility
to protect can be reached through discussions like this
one, and to that end, we support this year’s inclusion of
the responsibility to protect as a stand-alone item on the
agenda of the General Assembly

====================

With time, the historical memory of atrocities and
crimes against humanity fades and the significance of
“never again” wanes. However, we must not forget the
events, actions and inaction that led to such atrocities,
and we must dedicate ourselves to preserving our
shared memory of them. Through political events and
the context of crises — although they are different today
from what they were in Srebrenica and Rwanda, more
than 20 years ago — we are still seeing States failing
to protect their own populations from atrocity crimes

====================

The nature of today’s crises has raised questions
about the viability of the principle of the responsibility to
protect, given today’s geopolitical realities — questions
such as how we can uphold this principle when non-State
actors are shaping conflicts. What about when conflict
endures for years and, in some cases, decades? Who
shoulders the responsibility to protect — is it Member
States, international legal bodies or new institutions
altogether? And in assuming that responsibility,
what are the right tools for protecting civilians from
atrocity crimes?
There is also the question of the status of the
responsibility to protect when the international bodies
tasked with defending peace and security struggle to
reach a consensus and take action. Arguably, in various
cases, Security Council paralysis has contributed to
prolonging violent conflict around the world, and to
address that, the United Arab Emirates supports the
initiative led by France and Mexico on limiting the
use of the veto in cases of mass atrocities and the
code of conduct of the Accountability, Coherence and
Transparency group

====================


The United Arab Emirates joins others here
today in reaffirming our shared commitment to the
responsibility to protect, as endorsed in the 2005
World Summit Outcome document. We believe that the
responsibility to protect populations from crimes against
humanity rests, first and foremost, with sovereign
States. However, in this context, we believe that the
concept of sovereignty is a right with a concomitant
responsibility. A sovereign State’s responsibility to
protect extends to addressing the root causes of conflict
and, where necessary, seeking assistance and technical
support from regional partners, the United Nations and
its Member States

====================

Furthermore, it is only as a matter of last resort,
when a State has clearly violated its obligations
under international law and has failed to fulfil its the
responsibility to protect, that intervention is warranted

====================

Any intervention or military action that might come
with upholding the responsibility to protect could be
undertaken only with the consent of the sovereign State
in question or when authorized by the Security Council,
and it therefore strengthens the Security Council’s
toolkit of responses to crises

====================

The Secretary-General has outlined a robust
threefold strategy for strengthening early action,
including promoting accountability for atrocity
prevention. The United Arab Emirates stresses that
ensuring accountability for mass atrocity crimes is
vital to preventing their recurrence

====================

In our own region, we continue to experience
multiple armed conflicts with severe repercussions
for civilian communities. In that context, doubts about
precise facts and figures can lead to impunity for
those who commit atrocities. One way to objectively
verify such crimes is to create agreed-on mechanisms
for collecting data that is beyond dispute, so that the
international community can react promptly and
responsibly to major developments. Another way is
reinforcement through legal frameworks set up by
international bodies, as the Security Council did
with resolution 2379 (2017), which established an
investigative team tasked with collecting, storing and
preserving evidence of Da’esh’s crimes in Iraq

====================

In collecting data and understanding developments
on the ground, civilians can play a role in early warning
and assessment and in bringing situations of concern
to the attention of the international community, as
the Secretary-General has rightly highlighted in his

report (A/72/884). Although the State’s responsibility
to protect is owed to its people, civilians should not be
treated merely as silent beneficiaries. They are partners,
and civilian action helps to prevent atrocity crimes

====================

The United Arab Emirates concurs with others
that we can collectively reaffirm our commitment here
today by first supporting the Secretary-General and his
focus on prevention so as to address the root causes of
conflict before intervention is required. How do we do
that? Clearly, strengthening the role of women in the
prevention of atrocity crimes supports that goal. As the
Secretary-General makes clear in his report, research
tells us that gender equality and the full inclusion of
women in peace processes, and as preventive actors,
greatly reduces a society’s exposure to risks of violence,
including atrocity crimes

====================

Furthermore, atrocity prevention must fully reflect
the tenets laid out in the women and peace and security
agenda and in resolution 1325 (2000). We must ensure
that women are empowered and supported as agents
of change in atrocity prevention. The United Arab
Emirates encourages the continued cooperation, as
called for by the Secretary-General, of his Special
Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide and, when
appointed, on the Responsibility to Protect, with UNWomen, the relevant mandate holders and regional
actors to achieve that goal. Prevention efforts must also
include an established and institutionalized programme
for bringing in the voices of young people

====================

Secondly, it is imperative to shift the dialogues
on the responsibility to protect out of New York and
into regions and capitals, so that we can find regional
and national solutions. To that end, the SecretaryGeneral’s report rightly highlights the importance of
regional and subregional arrangements, linking them
to decision-making on early action in preventing
atrocities and responding effectively to risks of atrocity
crimes. Such arrangements can be further developed by
reviewing and enhancing preventive capacities, as well
as sharing those best practices with Member States here
in New York

====================

Thirdly and finally, committing to a robust human
rights regime is key to the prevention agenda. That
includes an emphasis on strong institutions and good
governance at the regional and international levels.
