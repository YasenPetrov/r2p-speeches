INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT

In his address to the Stanley Foundation Conference on the Responsibility to Protect
(R2P), in New York on 18 January 2012, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon stated:

In 2011, history took a turn for the better. The responsibility to protect came of
age; the principle was tested as never before (...) We gave hope to people long
oppressed. In Libya (...) by our words and actions, we demonstrated that human
protection is a defining purpose of the United Nations in the twenty-first century

====================


Security Council authorized intervention in Libya did not put an end to violence and had
the unintended effect of exacerbating tensions on the ground and causing more harm
than good to the very same civilians it was supposed to protect. It soon became clear
that the interventionsâ€™ goal was not the protection of civilians but regime change

====================

Furthermore, large quantities of weapons and ammunition from the conflict, including
surface-to-air-missiles and man-portable air defense systems, found their way to
neighboring countries, exacerbating insecurity, organized crime and terrorism in the
region

====================


Rather than questioning whether military intervention may do more harm than good,
many R2P proponents often argue that the real risk comes from too few military
interventions. This rather causal approach to military intervention ignores the potential
for escalating violence, civilian casualties, damage to infrastructure, and the many
potential negative effects associated with the use military force

====================


The centrality of military intervention in R2P is obvious when one considers that the
coercive option is the only one of the three pillars that is widely funded and functional

====================

For example, bombing Libya cost approximately 1 billion dollars and that is just the
incremental cost, because the forces were already funded and trained. That is about 13
times more than what was spent in reconstructing the country. In the meantime, the
Peacebuilding Fund faces severe challenges to raise just $100 million. What we are trying to say is that rather than unhelpfully pitting two fundamental,
overriding principles of international law, non-intervention and the protection of human
rights,against each other and focusing on building a last resort option for when all else
fails, there is a dire need to devote all attention, energy and resources to ensuring that
the system does not fail to begin. with. But there seems to be no real commitment to do
this and thus the existing funding gap for prevention and sustaining peace in this
Organization

====================


More than ten years have gone by since paragraphs 138 and 139 were adopted

====================

Peacekeeping and peacebuilding have been reviewed openly and transparently. The
same should be done with R2P and so we call on the PGA to convene an open ended
working group to review the responsibility to protect with a view to adopting
simultaneous resolutions in the General Assembly and the Security Council by this time
next year

====================


Thank you.
