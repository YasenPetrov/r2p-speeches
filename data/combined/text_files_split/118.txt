Statement delivered by Sudan – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2017
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]

Mr. Moderator,
The horrific crimes do not occur in a vacuum. They are linked to internal conflicts. This is why
there is an urgent need to address the root causes of conflicts, especially the internal conflicts

====================

These conflicts are often attributed to a lack of social development and economic development

====================

It is also attributed to the disparity in various regions of the countries in the world. This is why
we do need to focus on social, economic and environmental development in order to address
the root causes of conflict and in order to prevent atrocity crimes. In this regard, we need to
provide assistance to developing countries, to build their capacities in the field of the rule of law,
development, economic and social development, and building States’ institutions and ensuring
national unity

====================

Mr. Moderator,
Nonintervention is a principle that is enshrined in the United Nations Charter. There is no
exception to this principle on humanitarian grounds. However, the Security Council has found
different interpretations of Chapter 7 to find an excuse and exercise the right to intervene. As a
result, there are a number of questions that we need to raise. They are related to the authority
and credibility of the Security Council in legal capacity to authorize military intervention, its
political will to do so and its overall performance and of course its non-representative
membership and the institutional double standards, as only the P5 have the right to veto. There
are many grounds to be dissatisfied with the Security Council. We are warning against legalizing
and legislating for intervention regardless of whether intentions were good or bad

====================

In 2011, some countries, and I refer here to the P5, intervened in neighboring countries of Sudan

====================

This led to grave repercussions. This country and the neighboring countries and the world at large
is still paying the price

====================

Mr. Moderator,
Protecting civilians is a noble cause. However, it should be done by the countries in question as
they bear this responsibility. It should not be used as a political tool to achieve narrow interests
or to trade the suffering of civilians and to legitimize practices that run counter to the Charter of
the United Nations and international law

====================

Mr. Moderator,

There is a need for concerted action by States and the international community to address the
root causes of internal conflicts. We are making efforts to apply the responsibility to protect

====================

Mr. Moderator,
The objective is to strengthen and not to weaken the sovereignty of states and we do need to
improve the int’l community’s capacity to respond decisively when states are committing
atrocities and failing to protect their own people. We have to reconcile these two objectives and
that requires further examination and creativity in finding new solutions within the int’l law. This
is why we support more informal discussions within the General Assembly to reach a consensus
on the different aspects of the responsibility to protect. Only then can we include it as an item
on the formal agenda of the General Assembly. We believe that the time has not come yet to
reach positive results there is still lack of consensus on the concept of the responsibility to protect
so there is a danger in applying double standards, in exploiting this concept and using it in a very
selective way to punish certain countries and leaving others behind

====================

Thank you, Mr. Moderator

====================
