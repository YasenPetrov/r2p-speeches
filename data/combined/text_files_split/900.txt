The
United States does not take trade-policy direction
from the General Assembly. Further restrictions on the
materials used in capital punishment are inconsistent
with international law, which recognizes the authority
of States to impose the death penalty for the most serious
crimes. The United States is a signatory neither to the
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment nor to the Second Optional Protocol to the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

For these reasons, we are opposed to draft resolution
A/73/L.94.
