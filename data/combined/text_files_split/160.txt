Informal Interactive Dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect
6 September 2016
Ambassador Laura E. Flores H. – Permanent Representative of Panama to the
United Nations
Excellencies,

Distinguished Delegates,

Ladies and Gentleman,

I would like to begin by thanking the office of the PGA for convening this timely dialogue
as well as the panelists who have shared their views earlier this morning. The
responsibility to protect is an important commitment for us Member States

====================

Panama adheres itself to the statement delivered by the Netherlands on behalf of the
Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect

====================


We welcome the eighth report of the Secretary-General on the Responsibility to Protect
and join our voice to his call for a collective action to prevent and respond to atrocity
crimes

====================


The report, even in its title, presents us with a clear vision: In the next decade of R2P,
the key to advance is to mobilize collective action from a multitude of stakeholders

====================


The prevention of “atrocity crimes”, such as genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and
crimes against humanity should be the primary responsibility of State authorities. In
addition, a vibrant civil society sector is crucial to strengthen and support national
capacities. Their collaboration with Member States and their presence on the field is
crucial to identify potential risks that threaten populations and, in turn, prevent the
occurrence of atrocity crimes. Civil Society can also play a key role at the local level by
overcoming barriers and mobilizing action

====================

Mr. President,
We are pleased to see progress in the recognition of the Responsibility to Protect within
the Security Council. The decisions taken by the Council are crucial to the prevention of
atrocity crimes. We therefore call upon the Permanent members of the Security Council
to restrain from using their veto in these situations as proposed by France and Mexico
and as expanded through the Code of Conduct promoted by the ACT group and which
112 countries have subscribed, pledging not to vote against situations that could
become acts of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, in line with the primary
role of the Security Council which is to ensure international peace and security. Any
failure to uphold these duties severely undermines not only this body, but also the entire
United Nations system

====================


We need a paradigm shift that emphasizes ethical values, to ensure that our actions are
just and fair

====================


Mr. President,
My delegation calls upon all Member-States to implement the recommendations made
in the Secretary General report, to recommit to prevention, to ensure accountability at
all levels, and to do everything in their power to prevent the recurrence of atrocity
crimes. The protection of populations from these crimes can only be done through
capacity building and genuine political will

====================


In conclusion, we would like to reiterate our commitment to the full and consistent
implementation of the three pillars of R2P, and encourage the next Secretary-General of
the United Nations to prioritize and commit to this important norm

====================


Thank you

====================
