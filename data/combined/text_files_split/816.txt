During a previous meeting
in this important debate, a week ago (see A/72/PV.100),
we placed on record our objection to yet another attempt
by the delegation of Pakistan to misuse this forum. We
are constrained to take the floor again today. Repeated
and cynical attempts by Pakistan — a hub of terrorism
in our region and beyond — to spread a false narrative
about the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir have not

succeeded in the past and will not do so now. We do not
wish to engage any further on the matter.
