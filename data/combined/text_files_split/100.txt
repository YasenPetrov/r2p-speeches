Statement on behalf of the Group of Friends
of the Responsibility to Protect at the
UN General Assembly
Informal Interactive Dialogue on the Responsibility
to Protect

New York, 6 September 2017

1

Mr. President,

I have the honor of delivering this statement on behalf of the
Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect, consisting of 49
Member States and the European Union, and co-chaired by the
Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Rwanda

====================

The Group thanks the President of the General Assembly for
convening this Informal Interactive Dialogue

====================

We also thank the Secretary-General for his Report on
Implementing the Responsibility to Protect: Accountability for
Prevention

====================

We welcome the fact that the report underscores that R2P is a
key element of the Secretary-General’s prevention agenda

====================

The Group of Friends shares the view that we must prioritize the
prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity, not just in word but also in deed

====================

We also agree that legal, political and moral accountability is
critical in order to translate R2P into an agenda for individual and
collective action

====================

2

For our part, in addition to reaffirming our resounding
commitment to R2P as enshrined in paragraphs 138 and 139 of
the World Summit Outcome Document, we want to highlight a
number of points from the Secretary-General’s Report that we
consider are critical

====================

We firmly agree that the cornerstone of R2P is the primary
responsibility of States to protect their population from mass
atrocity crimes

====================

In this context, we welcome the issuance of the SecretaryGeneral’s five recommendations for domestic action, and take
this opportunity to encourage all Member States to conduct
periodic self-assessments to ascertain how national efforts to
prevent atrocity crimes can be strengthened

====================

We share the Secretary-General’s view that accountability for
mass atrocity crimes is among the most effective ways of
preventing their recurrence

====================

The Group of Friends of R2P stresses that the fight against
impunity and ensuring accountability for genocide, crimes against
humanity, and war crimes is strengthened through the
prosecution of these crimes in national and international criminal
justice systems

====================

3

In this respect, we underline the primary role of national judicial
systems and the importance of the progress of international
criminal justice in the past years

====================

Members of the Group of Friends of R2P have different positions
on the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; many
have joined, while others have chosen not to do so

====================

The Group of Friends supports holding accountable all those
responsible for mass atrocity crimes

====================

The Security Council has the authority to play a unique role in the
prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity

====================

It is in everyone’s interest to have a Security Council that
responds in a timely and appropriate manner where there is a
real risk of these crimes being committed

====================

We call on all Members of the Council to act in a manner to
support responding to and addressing the risk or commission of
mass atrocity crimes, noting in this context the support of many
Member States for the ACT Code of Conduct and the
French/Mexican initiative on veto restraint

====================

4

The Security Council must of course have the necessary
information in order to be able to act

====================

We encourage the Secretary-General to use his powers under
Article 99 of the Charter to bring to the attention of the Council
any risk or commission of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
or crimes against humanity that in his opinion may threaten the
maintenance of international peace and security

====================

In this context, we also encourage all States to support the
Special Advisers on the Responsibility to Protect and the
Prevention of Genocide and their Joint Office, and welcome the
efforts of the Secretariat to contribute to R2P’s implementation
through the commitment to Human Rights up Front, and the
development of the Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes

====================

We encourage States to use this document in their prevention
efforts

====================

To translate early warning to early action, we must make use of
all tools at our disposal

====================

As the Secretary-General’s Report correctly highlights, the
Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review is also well
placed to support prevention efforts, and we welcome the
suggestions made in the Report as to how the UPR could be
better utilized

====================

5

The General Assembly of course also can play an important role,
not least when Security Council action is blocked, as
demonstrated by the GA’s establishment of the International,
Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) for crimes
committed in Syria

====================

Indeed, the Group of Friends considers that the General
Assembly could, and should, be playing a more active role to
support States in their efforts to carry out their primary
responsibilities to protect populations from mass atrocity crimes

====================

The 2005 World Summit Outcome Document stressed the need
for the General Assembly to continue consideration of R2P

====================

We welcome the fact that the Secretary-General has
recommended the inclusion of an item on prevention and R2P in
the GA agenda in order to facilitate a continuous, frank and
inclusive dialogue

====================

We call on all Member States to support the request made by
Australia and Ghana for the inclusion of such an item in the
agenda of the Assembly for the 72nd Session

====================

Mr. President,
The first two sentences of the Secretary-General’s Report really
say it all: ‘There is a gap between our stated commitment to the
Responsibility to Protect and the daily reality confronted by
populations exposed to the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity

====================

To close this gap, we must ensure that the responsibility to
Protect is implemented in practice

====================

This gap can, and must, be closed. The Group of Friends of R2P
is committed to working with all stakeholders to help make this
a reality
