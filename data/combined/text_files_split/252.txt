Statement delivered by the Delegation of Costa Rica to the United Nations, at the United
Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion "From commitment to
implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened by the President
of the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
25 February 2016
Costa Rica actively participates in several initiatives whose aim it is to promote the
implementation of Responsibility to Protect, such as the Latin American Network for the
Prevention of Genocide, the Global Action Against Mass Atrocity Crimes, and, together with
Denmark, Ghana and Australia, we are part of the group that convenes the Global Network of
National Focal Points on Responsibility to Protect. Costa Rica welcomes that, so far, 51
members in addition to the EU have designated a national Focal Point on Responsibility to
Protect which strengthens their preventative capacities and urges States which have not yet
done so to designate a Focal Point and join the Global Network

====================

We are very satisfied by the significant progress made in implementing the Responsibility to
Protect and its 3 pillars which is reflected in the increasingly frequent discussions we have on
the topic as well as the inclusion of the principle in many resolutions of important organs, such
as the Security Council and the HRC

====================

We also recognize that there is a growing commitment to implement the principle by the
international community and to create initiatives, such as the framework for analysis of atrocity
crimes, which address risk factors and protect populations. Along the same lines, we stress
the work done by the Special Advisors on the Prevention of Genocide and Responsibility to
Protect

====================

We believe, however, that much remains to be done. Prevention, early warning and an
effective, rapid and appropriate response are imperative. Article 99 of the UN Charter grants
the SG the authority to intervene on a timely basis to prevent conflict and eliminate threats to
international peace and security and protect the human rights of populations. We believe that
this tool must be used more effectively to ensure respect of the purposes and principles of the
Charter

====================

In like manner, we wish to urge support for the ACT Code of Conduct and we urge permanent
member of the Security Council to voluntarily refrain from using the veto in situations of
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We welcome that, so
far, 110 States are signatories of this and we urge those who have not done so to adhere to
it. Considering the possibility that this, in the future, will be a valuable parameter in the
selection of candidates to the Security Council

====================
