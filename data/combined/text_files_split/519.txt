concept coming up as a .f~oter-r.tiaIly

applicatiox~should confo~rrnto the princjplc nE objectivity and non-selectiviiy. We support the view
that the scope of th.e R2B l:!oncept shnu1.d.be Iimited to tl~nfour 'types nl: h.dnou,scrim.es as mentioned

Mr. I'resident,
'The c o ~ ~ c eof
p t PUP should also look into the root causes that lead to a situation where a State is said
tcj be 'laili11g' to protect its own citizens,,rat11e.r than going. far enforcement: action after ,the global
comwntmity has allnwecl t.hatState to slide into chaos

====================

P?P's primary tools shvu.:ld be persua,sion and support, not milimy or other f o l m of coercion, Only
if:prevention.fails, R2P mi:ight dl-aw ctn 0 t h measures
~ ~

- economic, political, ciipIomakic, or a$ the fast

resort 171i1'1itary.It, therefwe, should develop a preventive framework that ,would take due note of the

warnin.g sipis and act imtankaneously without .pl-eiudice

====================

,
f~this con~~ection,
we h l l y agree t21a.t it if;
veay important that early wa.rnS,ngand assessment be effected fajrly, pmdendy and professionally,
withou:k being motivated by rral.rc?w and self-serving politicaf goals and interests. Similarly, as
mentioned earlier, jts app'lica2rion should bs non-selective md devoid of dntlblc shdards. These are
the pri,nciples which werr: well-nrticulated in para 11 of th.e Secretay General's report In the final
analysis, we have to make!sure that there will be na room for any mx@ of error

====================

Tn conclttsion, let ale und'i!riine that,

,in the event wc reach a stage where the $ecuriky Council has to

take rxwessary action, we expect t h a t it fulfills hdly its rresponsibly as entrusted by the elltire UN
mclmbersltip, Perhaps, om debate on the Security Council reforms-during its discussion on t l ~ s
'working methods' a,t.tldayrplicatim~of 'veto' should take tkis into account to make RZP more effective

I tl1an.k you Mr. 'President
