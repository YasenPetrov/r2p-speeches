2017 UN General Assembly Dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect
“Implementing the Responsibility to Protect: Accountability for Prevention”
Statement by Ms. Tina J. Park
Canadian Centre for the Responsibility to Protect
New York | 6 September 2017

[CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY]
Mr. President,
Thank you for convening this important dialogue on R2P. The Canadian
Centre for the Responsibility to Protect fully endorses the SecretaryGeneral’s report on improving accountability mechanisms for prevention

====================

We would also like to extend our warmest welcome to Dr. Ivan Simonovic

====================

Mr. President, the need for timely and decisive action to protect people in
peril is greater than ever before. We continue to witness the greatest
humanitarian challenge of our times in Syria, with over 400,000 civilian
casualties and some 6.1 million internally displaced people and 4.8 million
refugees. In North Korea, millions are dying from starvation and crimes
against humanity committed by the dictatorship. Since this spring, there
have been over 500,000 cholera cases in Yemen, with 41% of cases
covering children under the age of 15. Even as we speak, a child dies in
Yemen every five minutes. In too many parts of the world, too many
innocent children are killed every day while we look the other way

====================

But there is another truth—equally clear and compelling. We are here today
because, right now, we realize that we are facing a crisis of epic
proportions. We are here because we realize that we can no longer afford
to tolerate violence with impunity. We are here because we believe that
Responsibility to Protect principle provides us with tools to tackle the test of
our common humanity. Instead of giving into cynicism and despair, we are
choosing hope and courage

====================


The Canadian Centre for the Responsibility to Protect respectfully
offers three points as we look ahead:
First, we urge member states to build domestic institutional
mechanisms to end the culture of impunity. These measures include
ratifying and implementing core instruments of international human rights
and humanitarian law, appointing a national focal point on R2P, and
working closely with national parliaments to improve political accountability
at home

====================

Second, we urge member states to invest in education and empower the
youth. We need systematic and holistic approach to teach the values of
pluralism and diversity from young age, and also set the bar high by
holding perpetrators accountable

====================

Lastly, we urge member states to look for new partners and new
resources to address the gap between our intent and capacity. We have
made enormous progress in our conceptual understanding of R2P. The
central challenge we face concerns our capacity to coordinate our efforts
and respond effectively. Building real capacity will require political
leadership and inputs from the private sector, the academia, the civil
society, and regional and sub-regional organizations. We must be
innovative in using technology to tackle the root causes of conflicts

====================


Exercising our collective responsibility to protect will never be an easy
task, and countering violent extremism and sectarianism will require new
strategies, partnerships and deployable resources

====================

At the Canadian Centre for R2P, we're determined to do our part. We will
continue to speak up for justice and equality, and insist that the universal
human rights of every person are upheld, everywhere

====================

Thank you

====================
