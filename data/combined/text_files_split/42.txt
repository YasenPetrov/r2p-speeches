Statement delivered by Chile – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2016
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]
Thank you, Moderator

====================

We believe that this is a unique opportunity to go into greater depth and support the Responsibility to
Protect from prevention point of view. This is a part of the tools for integral reform, in order to construct
resilient societies. In the current context of reforming the U.N., as carried forward by the UN SecretaryGeneral, this forms part of it. We would like to see a broad base for this protection. This is crucial for us

====================

It should be included within the UN System as a whole. We would therefore like to welcome the policies
of protection against retaliation and we recognize a need for a victims-approach fully supported by the
organization as a guarantor of transparent and legitimate processes. However, we must not forget that
even when R2P can be seen as a tool in support of reform it must fully comply with the organization’s
mandates, so as not to undermine the processes began since its adoption in 2005

====================

Mr. Moderator, we support the recommendation of incorporating R2P as an agenda item, but we would
also like to call for respect for the work of the organization and its principals and prerogatives; aiming at
operationalizing humane lines of action proposed and giving priority to the rights and dignity of victims;
ending impunity; promoting the participation of civil society and local communities amongst other actors,
as well as improving strategic communications for awareness and transparency. We also strongly
emphasize the relevant role of women in the prevention of atrocity crimes on the understanding that this
can be a key element for early warning and peacebuilding, promoting cooperation, capacity building,
support networks and building more cohesive and inclusive societies

====================

We support the initiatives to refrain from the use of the veto within the security council, human rights
upfront and also value the work and effort of the office of the Special Advisor on the Prevention of
genocide, the Special Advisor on the Responsibility to Protect and the Global Centre for R2P, especially its
coordination as secretariat of the Focal Points Network

====================

Finally Moderator, for Chile, the Responsibility to Protect and the commitment of the Secretary-General
in the interests of transparency, prevention and accountability together with the other reforms of the
system will leave an indelible mark on the work of the organization, repositioning the public character of
the work that we do

====================


Thank you
