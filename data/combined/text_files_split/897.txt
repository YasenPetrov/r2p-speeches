I would like to begin by
making reference to the 2009 report of the SecretaryGeneral on this subject, which asserts that:
“The task ahead is not to reinterpret or renegotiate
the conclusions of the World Summit but to find
ways of implementing its decisions in a fully
faithful and consistent manner.” (A/63/677, para. 2)
Yet, precisely 10 years after the report, that
particular assertion still has validity in our present time

====================

My delegation has been engaged in various debates on
this topic, whether under this agenda item or different
settings in the halls of the Organization. A divergence of
views still exists regarding this concept. Nevertheless,
my delegation is also cognizant and appreciative of
the efforts to operationalize the concept and meet the
noble objectives and purposes that it is intended to
serve. Needless to say, there are also stringent views
regarding how to forge a clear and practical modality
for that concept, and in fact, whether it should stand as
an agenda item at all

====================

In that connection, allow me to recall our position
that the inclusion of this topic as a one-off agenda item
at the seventy-second session of the General Assembly
would be an option for the purpose of enriching
the knowledge of States Members of the United
Nations concerning the strengthening of the primary
responsibility of States. My delegation would therefore
continue to insist that deliberation on this topic should
be on the basis of consensus so that any process that we

choose to advance is one that garners collective support
and ownership, and not the imposition of the few or
even the majority. Against that backdrop, I would like
to make the following points

====================

First, a few divergent views do exist, particularly
on pillar III, and that requires a careful approach. But,
at the same time, we cannot be complacent with what
we have achieved with pillars I and II. That atrocities
and conflicts are still continuously occurring in many
parts of the world is clear evidence of the lack of
prevention and early-warning mechanism efforts by
the United Nations. The Charter of the United Nations
already provides the tools to take such steps, and we
need to exhaust them

====================

Secondly, the openness of the concept should be in
line with the provisions of the United Nations Charter
that promote peaceful and appropriate diplomatic means,
as well as non-coercive measures. The concept of the
responsibility to protect does not provide justifications
for unilateral action. It reinforces the primacy of
multilateralism, as embodied in the United Nations
Charter, for the assumption of that responsibility

====================

Thirdly, any effort to establish links between
violations of human rights and the presumed imminence
of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes
against humanity should be forged carefully so as to
avoid creating criteria or thresholds that are expansive
or intrusive and could be misleading

====================

There are indeed divergent views on the practicality
and operationalization of this concept. The politicization
of the concept will only widen such divergence. Instead,
we should focus on concrete cooperation to help build
capacity in the exchange of views and learn from each
other’s experiences. My delegation remains prepared to
positively engage in the discussion of this concept with
the objective of reaching consensus and achieving the
collective engagement of all Member States.
