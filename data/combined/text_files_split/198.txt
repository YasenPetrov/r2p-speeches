Mr. Moderator,

Georgia aligns itself with the statement made by the European Union earlier today and I'd
like to make few remarks in my national capacity

====================


Georgia reiterates its commitment to the consistent implementation of R2P via the three-
pillar framework. We attach great significance to the Global Network of R2P and here I'd
also like to acknowledge the important work of Special Advisers on the Prevention of
Genocide and Responsibility to Protect to further mainstream R2P through the UN system

====================


It is a joint responsibility of the international community to help protect populations from
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We, the UN Member
States should do our utmost to strengthen the efforts in fulfilling the collective
responsibility to protect populations in the face of imminent threat in accordance with
international law

====================


Georgia, as a country that has experienced several waves of ethnic cleansing and continues
to suffer from the foreign occupation of two of its regions, where grave and systematic
human rights violations need to be addressed, clearly recognizes the importance of the
principle of responsibility to protect

====================


We welcome the recent Report of the Secretary-General on “Mobilizing collective action:
the next decade of the responsibility to protect”. We fully concur with the view that the
implementation of the R2P has to move from commitments to actions and we need to take
common efforts to remove the barriers to the implementation of the principle

====================


The existing international and regional human rights mechanisms should remain in
forefront and should play major role in the implementation of Responsibility to Protect.
