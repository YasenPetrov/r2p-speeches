UNITED NATIONS
PRESS RELEASE
For immediate release
Statement by Adama Dieng, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of
Genocide, on recent inflammatory rhetoric by President Yahya Jammeh of the
Gambia, targeting the Mandinka ethnic group
(New York, 7 June 2016) The Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Prevention
of Genocide, Adama Dieng, condemned the inflammatory speech by President Yahya
Jammeh of the Gambia at a political rally in Tallinding on 3 June, in which he reportedly
threatened to eliminate the Mandinka ethnic group. President Jammeh allegedly referred
to the Mandinka as “enemies, foreigners” and threatened to kill them one by one and
place them “where even a fly cannot see them”

====================

“I am profoundly alarmed by President Jammeh’s public stigmatisation, dehumanisation
and threats against the Mandinka,” the Special Adviser stated. “Public statements of this
nature by a national leader are irresponsible and extremely dangerous. They can
contribute to dividing populations, feed suspicion and serve to incite violence against
communities, based solely on their identity.”
The Special Adviser was particularly appalled by President Jammeh’s vitriolic rhetoric as
history has shown that hate speech that constitutes incitement to violence can be both a
warning sign and a powerful trigger for atrocity crimes. “We have seen, in Rwanda,
Bosnia – and more recently in the Middle East - how incitement to violence has led to
mass killings along identity lines,” the Special Adviser stated. He reminded President
Jammeh that any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence is prohibited under international human
rights law as well as under national legislation

====================

States have the primary responsibility to protect their populations. In 2005, all Heads of
State and Government acknowledged the responsibility to protect populations from
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, as well as their
incitement. “I urge the President of the Gambia to fulfil this responsibility,” said the
Special Adviser, “and ensure that the rights of all populations of the Gambia are
respected, irrespective of ethnicity or political affiliation.”
