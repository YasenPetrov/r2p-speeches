Statement by the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of
Genocide and the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Responsibility to
Protect on the escalation of incitement to violence in Syria on religious grounds

====================

(New York, 13 October 2015) The Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the
Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, and the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on
the Responsibility to Protect, Jennifer Welsh, expressed alarm at the escalation in violent
rhetoric by influential religious leaders in relation to the situation in Syria

====================

The Special Advisers condemned the recent call by clerics in Saudi Arabia for Sunni
Muslims and their States to support a “holy war” against Shia Muslims and Christians in
Syria, as well as against States and non-State armed groups perceived to support them. “Such
rhetoric can aggravate the already extremely volatile situation in Syria by drawing religiously
motivated fighters to join all parties to the conflict, thus escalating the risk of violence against
religious communities.” They added that “advocacy of religious hatred to incite or justify
violence is not only morally wrong, but also prohibited under international law.”
Dieng and Welsh also expressed concern at reports that Russian Orthodox clerics had earlier
referred to the Russian participation in the conflict in Syria as a “holy battle” against
terrorism. “Statements of this kind can be manipulated, feed suspicion and increase
polarisation of communities.” The Special Advisers noted the response by Russian authorities
who reportedly denied that there was any religious connotation to their involvement in Syria

====================

They praised the organisation Syrian Christians for Peace for rejecting the concept of a
Christian “holy war” and condemning those who invoke it

====================

The Special Advisers called on States to dissociate themselves from and condemn any form
of advocacy of religious hatred, promote dialogue and protect and empower all those
religious figures and human rights defenders who are working towards enhancing interreligious respect and harmony

====================

The Special Advisers also called on religious leaders around the world to refrain from any
form of advocacy of religious hatred and incitement to violence, and to counter any use of
such rhetoric. They stressed that “religious leaders should be messengers of peace, not of
war. In situations in which tensions are high, as in Syria, religious leaders should call for and
foster restraint and dialogue, rather than fanning the flames of hatred.”
