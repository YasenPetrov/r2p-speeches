I would like to explain the
position of the Government of Japan on draft resolution
A/73/L.94

====================

We find two serious issues in the draft resolution:
first is the reference to the death penalty and the second
the reference to the legitimacy of trade regulations

====================

Article 2 of the Convention against Torture and
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment stipulates State parties’ obligation to
prevent acts of torture in any territory under their
jurisdiction. No exceptional circumstances whatsoever
may be invoked as a justification of torture

====================

The prevention of torture is well established under
international human rights law. The international
community should act in concert to ensure that such
prevention is implemented. Japan has no objection
to discussing possible measures to prevent torture

====================

However, there is no universal understanding that the
death penalty constitutes an act of torture or other cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is up
to the national criminal justice system of each Member
State to either abolish or retain the death penalty

====================

Addressing the death penalty and torture in the
same draft resolution leads to confusion concerning

the two issues. That confusion not only gives rise to
unconstructive friction between Member States but also
makes it difficult to take coordinated action towards
the prevention of torture

====================

My delegation has constructively engaged in
informal negotiations, offering concrete amendment
proposals on the understanding that the deletion of
references to the death penalty with a strong focus on
the prevention of torture would be a precondition for
the discussion of trade regulations

====================

Many countries expressed similar concerns
during the negotiations. However, the co-sponsors
did not offer the opportunity for sufficient dialogue
on these important concerns and did not accept the
draft amendments. Under these circumstances, today’s
action on the draft resolution in the General Assembly
is deeply regrettable

====================

My delegation cannot accept the current text,
which addresses torture and the death penalty in the
same sentence

====================

For that reason, Japan will vote against the
draft resolution.
