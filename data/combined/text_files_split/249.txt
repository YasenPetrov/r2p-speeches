Statement delivered by the Delegation of Slovenia to the United Nations, at the United
Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion on "From commitment to
implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened by the President of
the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
26 February 2016
Mr. Moderator,
Let me start by thanking the President of the General Assembly for convening this important
meeting and also all panelists for very insightful presentations for which we are very thankful

====================

As a member of the cross-regional group of countries that prepare this draft General Assembly
resolution on RtoP, which was formally presented yesterday, we received very mixed
reactions. We listened to everyone. Everyone was not only listened to, but also heard. Slovenia
calls on all member states to actively engage in negotiations that will lead to strong and
hopefully consensual adoption of a resolution, which will pave the way to better
implementation of the concept in the years to come

====================

In our opinion, and many panelists have expressed their position on that, the key element of RtoP
is prevention. It is imperative for us to consolidate the efforts at the national, regional, and global
levels in order to protect populations against genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and
ethnic cleansing. We also believe that we have to better use available preventive tools at our
disposal. When I say available tools I mean political, diplomatic, humanitarian, economic, and
legal, both in cooperative and coercive ways. No situation is identical and every situation requires
a tailor-made approach. Systematic human rights education, we believe, is an effective mode to
respect the rights of all peoples, which is itself a very important element of prevention

====================

True prevention can only happen with the political will of the countries involved. In this regard we
call on all current and future members of the Security Council not to block credible actions aimed
at preventing the most heinous and atrocious crimes. Slovenia supports the ACT Code of
Conduct regarding Security Council action against genocide, war crimes, and crimes against
humanity and of course we applaud the French-Mexican Initiative on voluntary restraint of the use
of the veto in mass atrocity situations. In this context, I would like to reiterate, Sloveniaâ€™s strong
support and continued support for the Secretary-General Initiative, Human Rights up Front,
as well as support to the Special Advisers for Genocide and RtoP, as well as, of course, civil
society organizations engaged in prevention action

====================

To conclude, Mr. Moderator, Slovenia encourages and also invites all member states not yet
parties to the international conventions, and especially the Rome Statute of the ICC that sets out
the legal framework for the prevention and punishment of mass atrocity crimes, to become party
as soon as possible. This can give a very clear signal that mass atrocities are not acceptable and
will not be tolerated and there will be no safe haven anywhere for perpetrators of mass atrocities

====================

Thank you, Mr. Moderator

====================
