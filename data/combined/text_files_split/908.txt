(spoke in Arabic): My
delegation would like to provide an explanation of vote
on draft resolution A/73/L.94

====================

My delegation participated in the consultations
from the very first negotiating meeting. We expressed
our concern about certain sensitive issues, foremost
of which is the linkage in the draft resolution between
torture and capital punishment. We clarified that capital
punishment is a sovereign national issue subject to the
applicable State laws. That is supported by paragraph 1

of resolution 73/175, which acknowledges the sovereign
right of States to implement their national legislation

====================

Torture is degrading and inhuman and cannot be
accepted under any law, norms and religions

====================

Moreover, paragraph 1 of the draft resolution
calls on the Secretary-General to establish common
international standards for the import, export and
transfer of goods used for torture. That is a very strange
request because it establishes a serious precedent that
is not compatible with international humanitarian law,
which rejects torture and calls on all States to stop
using that degrading practice

====================

For those reasons, my country’s delegation will
vote against the draft resolution

====================

The Acting President: We have heard the last
speaker in explanation of vote before the voting

====================

The Assembly will now take a decision on draft
resolution A/73/L.94, entitled “Towards torture-free
trade: examining the feasibility, scope and parameters
for possible common international standards”

====================

[Subsequently, the delegation of Togo informed the
Secretariat that it had intended to abstain.]
The Acting President: Before giving the floor
to speakers in explanation of vote after the voting, I
would like to remind delegations that explanations of
vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by
delegations from their seats

====================

Mr. Hassani Nejad Pirkouhi (Islamic Republic
of Iran): Resolution 73/304 attempts to establish a link
that does not exist between the prohibition of torture,
which is a peremptory norm under international law,
and the death penalty, which is recognized under
international law as a permissible measure for the most
serious crimes. For that reason, my delegation decided
to vote against resolution 73/304.
