Rwanda’s Statement at the 2016 UN General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion, From Commitment
to Implementation: Ten Years of Responsibility to Protect [Transcribed]
Mr. Moderator, if you allow me in my national capacity, I have just one question if it is possible. It will
not take more than one minute

====================

I ask Professor Gareth [Evans] and the other panelists a thought provoking question in light of what is
happening in Burundi

====================

We all know what is happening there. We have seen various statements of the [UN Security] Council
and other interested parties, including the AU [African Union] and other Member States. We have
various reports, some of them with a particular narrative, that have nothing to do with the prevention of
mass atrocities. Innocent civilians continue to pay the ultimate price

====================

As my president, President Kagame, recently put it, I quote, “As usual, when the toll will be finally
counted and found to be too high and questions asked about the Responsibility to Protect, the simple
answer will be ‘We did not know,’ read ‘We did not want to know.’ The argument, we go on and on, and
lives will continue to be lost. Instead of ‘Never Again’ we have ‘Yet Again.’”
I would really welcome your views, dear panelists, on this particular issue as someone who contributed
quite a lot in putting together the concept of R2P. I am sure this might be a difficult question but it will
help my understanding, our understanding, to see how we can protect the people in Burundi

====================

I am saying this in my own national capacity. I am so sorry to use this time

====================

I thank you, Sir

====================
