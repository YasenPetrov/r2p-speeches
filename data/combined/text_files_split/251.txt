Statement delivered by the Delegation of the Russian Federation to the United Nations, at
the United Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion on "From commitment
to implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened by the President
of the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
26 February 2016
Apart from the Jubilee of the World Summit Outcome document, which has already passed, we
would like to remind everyone about a more recent anniversary, and this is of Libya. Five years
ago it was bombed. In 2011, many enthusiastically labeled these bombings as the first case of
the practical application of the R2P concept. Currently, however, these events are considered to
be best forgotten

====================

Not surprisingly, I haven’t heard about Libya in the opening part of today’s session. Use of force
under the pretext of the protection of civilians led to complete disintegration of the Libyan state,
plunging the country in to complete havoc and instability. Such echoes of this tragedy, as the
migration crisis in the Mediterranean will linger for many years to come. That considered, we
have not seen a single attempt at frank and comprehensive analysis in what happened in Libya,
neither by the Secretariat nor by the member states

====================

The annual interactive dialogue on R2P has completely turned into the monologue of the
supporters of this concept. I say the monologue not because other views are not present, but
because they are listened to, but not heard. In such a situation, it would be difficult to discuss any
development of R2P whatsoever, including in the new substantive resolution of the GA, because
the fact that we have been unable to adopt such a resolution is quite telling that the consensus is
not there yet

====================

To finalize, I am very grateful to the esteemed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Kyrgyzstan
for the important clarification, as I was indeed surprised to hear the panel mention Kyrgyzstan as
well as some other countries as the R2P success stories. It is distorted information

====================

Thank you

====================
