The convening of today’s
formal debate on the responsibility to protect is a
milestone indeed, as it is the first such debate in the
General Assembly since 2009. It is our hope that this
debate will see an open and frank discussion, as it

presents a unique opportunity for all Member States to
put their views on record

====================

We thank the Secretary-General for his most recent
report on the responsibility to protect (A/72/884),
which points out that much more must be done by the
international community to prevent genocide, war
crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity,
and sets out recommendations on how early warning can
be improved. It also outlines a strategy for strengthening
early action. I would like to make three points

====================

First, as the Secretary-General has reiterated in his
report, the primary responsibility for the protection of
civilian populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity rests with
the State. National Governments cannot abdicate their
responsibility to protect their own citizens. Instability
and extremism flourish when the needs and aspirations
of citizens are not met. Accordingly, human development
is key and its link with the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is very important. The onus is on each
of us to implement the SDGs, in particular SDG 16, on
promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, justice for
all and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions

====================

We agree with the Secretary-General that inclusive and
sustainable development is the best form of prevention
against all kinds of risks, including atrocity crimes

====================

Secondly, international partnership and support are
essential to improving national resilience. The United
Nations, regional organizations and civil society must
work with one another to support and implement the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and create
in each of our countries the necessary institutions
and capacities for a resilient and inclusive society

====================

Prevention is certainly better than cure. The priority
must be to help countries ensure that the conditions for
instability and conflict do not arise. And when they do,
the international community must act collectively and
in a spirit of solidarity

====================

That leads me to my third point. The international
community must be prepared to take collective action
to help address situations where crimes of atrocity have
occurred. But to do so, it must act through the United
Nations, as was made clear in paragraph 139 of the
World Summit Outcome document, which our Heads
of State and Government endorsed in 2005. Our leaders
committed to taking such collective action through
the Security Council, in accordance with the Charter
of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis and in

cooperation with relevant regional organizations, as
appropriate. In addition, such collective action should
be undertaken only if peaceful means have proved to
be inadequate and national authorities have manifestly
failed to protect their populations from genocide, war
crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity

====================

Small States such as Singapore look to the Security
Council to fulfil its global responsibility to maintain
international peace and security. Unfortunately, we
have seen the veto used too often in the past to prevent
action to address atrocity crimes. We welcome the fact
that two of the five permanent members of the Council
have supported initiatives to limit the use of the veto in
cases of mass atrocities. We call on the other permanent
members to take a similar position by stating that
they will refrain from using the veto to block Council
action aimed at preventing or ending genocide, war
crimes and crimes against humanity. Such a collective
commitment by the permanent members is essential
if we are to signal the resolve of the Council and the
international community to support the responsibilityto-protect agenda

====================

Ultimately, the responsibility to protect should
be applied according to universally agreed principles
and the Charter, particularly the principle of State
sovereignty. The responsibility to protect is not a
justification for intervention by external actors in
the domestic affairs of sovereign States and should
not be used as such. The reality is that deep concerns
remain about the use of coercive or military measures
against the will of Member States. We must address
such concerns by building understanding, trust and
confidence in the concept of the responsibility to protect

====================

That can be done through continued dialogue among
Member States, which is the reason for Singapore’s
support of the inclusion of this item on the agenda of
the General Assembly

====================

The concept of the responsibility to protect must
not be seen to be imposed by one group of countries
on another, and neither should it be applied selectively
or in a way that is seen as furthering the political
agendas of some States. The primacy of the United
Nations system must be maintained in the application
of the responsibility to protect, and approval for any
intervention must be duly authorized. Application of
the responsibility to protect should not lead to unilateral
action or be allowed to weaken the multilateral rulesbased system. Through continued dialogue here in
the General Assembly, we are confident that the

international community can build trust and confidence
and advance our collective efforts to prevent and defeat
atrocity crimes.
