Statement delivered on behalf of the Permanent Mission of Canada to the United Nations
General Assembly informal, interactive dialogue on the “Responsibility to Protect: State
Responsibility and Prevention”
11 September 2013
(UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION)
Thank you Mr. President,
I would like to thank you for convening this interactive dialogue and also I like to take this opportunity
to welcome Dr. Jennifer Welsh and congratulate her on being appointed as Special Representative for
the Responsibility to Protect

====================

We have a commitment to preventing and halting of genocide, war crimes and crimes against
humanity wherever they may rise. States have a solemn duty defend the vulnerable, challenge
aggressors, protect and promote human rights and human dignity both at home and abroad

====================

Mr. President, this function starts with prevention. Although prevention strategies need to be adapted
according to international context, several common elements are crucial. Societies that have a respect
for diversity, a respect for religious minorities, who hold perpetrators of crimes legally responsible and
who resolve disputes in a democratic faction and seek reconciliation, are less likely to be subject to
atrocities. It is important to have a commitment from governments to promote the rule of law and the
rights of people

====================

The Secretary-Generals recent report provides guidance on implementing specific prevention
measures including safeguards, effective legislation, accountability mechanisms and national capacity
building in key sectors. Regional and sub-regional organizations have an important role to play in
sharing lessons and providing technical assistance. I can assure you, Mr. Chairman, that Canada will
continue to work with key-partners, and that we look to the UN system to implement atrocity
prevention as part of its core commitment. To reaffirming what is stated in the UN-Charter, and I quote
“faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of
men and women”

====================

Thank you Mr. President
