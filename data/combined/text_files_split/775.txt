(spoke in Arabic): Membership
of the United Nations remains the ultimate symbol of
State independence and sovereignty. It is the stamp
of approval in the community of nations. The United
Nations is also the principal international forum
for cooperative action to achieve three fundamental
objectives:
State-building,
nation-building
and
economic development. The United Nations is therefore
the main arena to protect State sovereignty and not to
give it up

====================

We take note of the Secretary Generalâ€™s report
(A/73/898) on the responsibility to protect (R2P) and
the noteworthy paragraphs therein. In a dangerous
world, which is characterized by inequality in power
and resources, sovereignty for many States is the best
line of defence and sometimes the only one. However,
sovereignty is more than just a functional principle in
international relations. For many States and peoples,
it is recognition of equality in status and dignity with
other States and peoples, as well as protection for their
unique identity and national freedom, in addition to
emphasizing their right to self-determination

====================

The concept of sovereignty as a responsibility
must not be interpreted as the possibility for any party
to intervene as long as the State is still standing and
able to exercise its authority and fulfil its obligations
towards its citizens. Paragraph 7 of Article 2 of the
Charter of the United Nations deals explicitly with
non-interference and does not include any clear reference
to humanitarian exception, as some would call it. It is
illegitimate to intervene in the internal affairs of States
based on international instruments and resolutions
adopted by the General Assembly. Non-interference

has a legal basis in international customary law through
many international, regional and bilateral instruments
that emphasize the prohibition of interference by a
State in the affairs of other States. Non-interference
is also ensured by general principles of law agreed by
civilized nations, as well as international organizations
and previous judicial judgments issued by international
courts such as the International Court of Justice

====================

Opinions of senior jurists as well as paragraphs 138
and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome document,
along with paragraphs 121 to 131, in which States
committed to improving and promoting human rights,
do not contain any explicit authorization or agreement
pertaining to the second or third pillar. All that warns
us against the threat of legalizing the right to interfere,
however good the intentions

====================

Efforts among States and the international
community must be concerted to eliminate the root
causes of internal conflicts. The required interference,
if we can call it that, means providing support to meet the
needs and political shortcomings, such as establishing
democracy and capacity-building; confidence-building
measures among communities and different groups;
and dealing with economic deprivation and a lack of
economic opportunities. Over the past three decades
there has been a dire need to decisively address the
causes of environmental deterioration, which has
become directly responsible for the outbreak of internal
conflicts. Assistance must include development
aid and cooperation in order to address inequality
in the distribution of resources and opportunities;
encouraging economic growth and opportunities;
improving terms of trade and allowing more goods from
developing economies to foreign markets; encouraging
the necessary economic and structural reform; and
providing technical support in order to strengthen
regulatory instruments and institutions

====================


and can be politicized and serve purposes and agendas
that have nothing to do with the basic and noble goal of
protecting civilians. It is observed from experience and
practice that certain organizations undertake political
exploitation in order to internationalize certain internal
issues by exaggerating some incidents or fabricating
others. Caution is therefore required because that
may increase tensions and have a negative impact on
achieving prevention

====================

The concept of R2P is a noble objective that States
undertake as a fundamental responsibility. It must not
be exploited as a political tool for attaining narrow
interests, causing suffering to civilians and legalizing
practices that contravene the principles of the Charter,
whose seventy-fifth anniversary we celebrated
yesterday, as well as international law. The primary
responsibility of a State is to protect its people from
genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and
ethnic cleansing, as well as incitement to perpetrate
those crimes. However, we cannot agree to grant some
States a blank cheque to intervene politically and
militarily in the internal affairs of States

====================

It is worth noting that there is no consensus on
the R2P concept. There remain concerns regarding its
definition, scope and implementation. We therefore
believe that more informal consultations, research,
analysis of causes and repercussions are needed

====================

Promoting the sovereignty of States and improving
the capability of the international community to
decisively respond when States are extensively violating
human rights and failing to protect their citizens are
two noble and fundamental objectives that need to be
reconciled. That requires further study and analysis,
as well as innovative solutions, under the umbrella of
international law

====================


Eliminating the root causes may also mean
enhancing legal protection and legal institutions. That
must include supporting efforts to strengthen the rule
of law and protect the independence and transparency
of the legal apparatus.
