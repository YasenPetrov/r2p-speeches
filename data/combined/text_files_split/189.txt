Statement delivered by Benin – Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2016 
[TRANSLATION] 
 
Mr. Chair, 
 
My Delegation is pleased to participate in this Interactive Dialogue on R2P and wishes to congratulate 
the organizers

====================

The promotion and protection of human rights indeed remain among the essential pillars of the United 
Nations to preserve peace and ensure sustainable human development. We must continue to work 
collectively for the protection and effective exercise of all human rights by all persons by removing the 
obstacles to the full exercise of those rights. It is crucial that the human rights instruments remain at 
the heart of the prevention of atrocities and heinous offenses

====================

Benin considers that the international community cannot exempt itself from its responsibilities when 
serious atrocities are committed against civilian populations. Moreover, Benin reiterates its adherence 
to the rules and principles of humanity that form the basis of the Responsibility to Protect and calls for 
the scrupulous respect of its spirit in its implementation. In every situation where the R2P is invoked, 
the means and forms of action of the international community must be proportional to the challenges 
that it is facing

====================

In accordance with the three pillars of R2P’s exercise, every time it is possible, the international 
community must prioritize coercive measures that are pacific by their nature, such as sanctions, 
commissions of inquiry and referrals to the International Criminal Court. These are vital instruments of 
deterrence that have been successful in the past. If, as a last resort, the use of force proves to be 
essential, it must be subject to strict regulation. Benin fully adheres to the principle of responsible 
exercise of R2P. We believe indeed that the unity of the Security Council, as well as its collegiality are 
major assets when it comes to saving lives

====================

In this regard, Benin reaffirms its adherence to the ACT Code of Conduct in cases of genocide, crimes 
against humanity or war crimes, as well as to the France/Mexico Initiative, which aims to restrain the 
voluntary use of the veto by the permanent members in cases of mass atrocities

====================

Moreover, my Delegation affirms its support to the Secretary-­‐General’s call to the States to reaffirm 
and intensify their commitment through a new resolution of the General Assembly on R2P

====================

Moreover, Benin would like to express its full support to the work of the Special Advisors on the 
Prevention of Genocide and on the Responsibility to Protect, and highlight the importance of their 
briefings regarding early warnings of situations which could lead to mass atrocity crimes

====================

To conclude, my Delegation would like to reaffirm the importance of the Kigali Principles for the 
protection of civilians and encourage all States to work for their full implementation
