Sweden fully aligns
itself with the statements delivered by the observer of
the European Union and by the representative of Qatar
on behalf of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility
to Protect (see A/72/PV.99)

====================

The responsibility to protect is a commitment to
protecting populations from atrocity crimes. In the 2005
World Summit Outcome document (resolution 60/1), all
States Members of the United Nations expressed their
commitment to the responsibility to protect concept and
its three pillars. Since then, the responsibility to protect
has received some misleading criticism in relation to
the use of military interventions to stop atrocity crimes

====================

Collective action under the third pillar may include
coercive or non-coercive measures, and it is imperative
that they are in accordance with the Charter of the
United Nations

====================

We need to acknowledge the responsibility to
protect in its broader sense and to stress the basics
of the concept. The core of the concept lies in
prevention. The continuing work on identifying risks,
developing early warning systems and early assessment
capabilities all aims to prevent atrocity crimes

====================

However, early warning must be followed by early
action. In that respect, we welcome the report of the
Secretary-General, entitled “Responsibility to protect:
from early warning to early action” (A/72/884). We
support the report’s recommendations, including with
regard to strengthening existing capacities, promoting
accountability and recognizing the contribution of
all actors, including the role of women, in preventing
atrocity crimes

====================

It is the obligation of each State to protect its
population. There is also the larger commitment of the
international community as a whole to supporting States
in meeting their responsibilities. We therefore welcome
the engagement of the international community and the
inclusion of the responsibility to protect as a formal
item on the agenda of the upcoming session of the
General Assembly.
