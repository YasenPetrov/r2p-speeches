Statement delivered by the Delegation of UNODC to the United Nations, at the United
Nations General Assembly Thematic Panel Discussion "From commitment to
implementation: Ten years of the Responsibility to Protect," convened by the President
of the General Assembly [Unofficial Transcription]
25 February 2016
It is clear, from the statements so far, that there is certainly deep interest on the issue and a
commitment from all sides to engage very passionately on this. We look forward to the
member States reaching consensus on this issues so as to provide guidance to the UN
system

====================

We just wanted to pick up on the issues of this UN system’s role, we think that it is important
that all parts of the UN family consider how the prevention of mass atrocity crimes impacts
their work. The UNODC, an organization which one might not commonly associate with
Responsibility to Protect, as early as 2005, right when the World Summit adopted paragraphs
138 and 139, released a report on crime and development in Africa cited a study which showed
how the experience of civil war increased homicide rates by 25% for a period of five years
after the end of the conflict irrespective of changes, such as the level of income, inequality or
the nature of State institutions. These issues are embedded in the work of all UN agencies
because they are critical and crucial

====================

In UNODC, for instance, we have signed MoUs with the ICC on the enforcement of sentences
and protection of victims, improving the capacity of States to enforce sentences and we
believe that this is a contribution to combating impunity. UNODC’s work on the rule of law,
under the STG’s particular goal 16, on creating just and inclusive societies, is tied into pillars
one and two of Responsibility to Protect

====================

We ask how all parts of the UN system, particularly those whose connection to Responsibility
to Protect may not be as immediately apparent, can better engage with the Responsibility to
Protect concept in their work

====================

We, all parts of the UN system, are guided by the work and role played by such important
advocates as Mr. Dieng whose personal role cannot be overstated, as seen by how he has
skillfully guided today’s debate. We very much appreciate the leadership on this
