Excellences,
Ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure to address you today on behalf of my country Montenegro,
country with proud and turbulent history that is strongly committed to
Responsibility to Protect

====================

The challenges we face today are real and serious - the effects of the evolving
nature of contemporary conflicts, mass atrocity crimes and more complex
security landscape will be felt for years to come. But the progress achieved in the
year behind us in advancing and institutionalizing R2P offers hope and an
Opportunity for making substantial changes for the common good. The 2017
report of the Secretary General and a new approach to international peace and
security is vital to our work with valuable measures for improving our response
to changing global security environment

====================

We fully agree that there is a pressing need to place greater emphasis on
prevention in the context of R2P. We should renew our efforts to prevent mass
atrocity crimes in every country and every community and therefore related key
international treaties and protocols should be signed; ratified and implemented,
and criminalization of mass atrocity crimes ensured on national level

====================

In the era of accountability, perpetrators of crimes against humanity should not
go unpunished. Every act of violence that goes unpunished or uninvestigated is an open invitation for further violence. Therefore, states should ensure that there
are adequate and effective mechanisms to bring to justice those responsible for
related crimes as acts of violation of international law and in that way to
strengthen resilience. We underline the important role of the ICC and national
judicial authorities to respond to genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and
crimes against humanity as they occur. The responsibility of the SC for referring
cases of crime against humanity to ICC remains indespensable

====================

We all need to demonstrate strong commitment to the rule of law, respect for
human rights and freedoms, democracy and non-use of force in settling
disputes. Montenegro strongly believes that human right mechanisms could
significantly support identifying risks and preventing atrocity crimes and
increase engagement between the Security Council and the HRC including its
special procedure mandate holders and UPR mechanism. Believing that veto
must not be used when there is a clear responsibility to protect, Montenegro
endorsed the French-Mexican initiative on voluntary restraint of veto use in cases
of mass atrocities, as well as the ACT Groups Code of Conduct regarding
Security Council action against genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity
and we call on all countries to do so

====================

Mr. President,

Preventing social exclusion and reducing disparities within our society through
economic and social development is a priority of Montenegrin Government. We
believe that with strong political will the implementation in practice of
cooperation with all human rights mechanisms across all states will be
substantially improved. Protecting women, men and children from crimes
against humanity, war crimes or genocide, ensuring that they live free of
violence, have equal access to education, healthcare, political and economic
opportunities, we will have healthier, more Prosperous and more peaceful
societies. It is our joint commitment to champion human rights and prevention
agenda around the world and Montenegro, as one of the first countries that
appointed focal point reaffirm its commitment to all three R2P pillars and stands
ready to be fully engaged in this regard.
