It is fitting that we
are gathered in this Hall to discuss the responsibility
to protect and the prevention of genocide, war crimes,
ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, a
timely topic amid a number of worrisome global
trends. Rwanda welcomes today’s formal debate in
the General Assembly at its seventy-second session on
the responsibility to protect, and congratulates Ghana
and Australia on their joint efforts to make the item
part of the formal agenda. Rwanda would like to also
thank the Secretary-General for his report (A/72/884),
entitled “Responsibility to protect: from early warning
to early action”

====================

My country aligns itself with the statement delivered
previously by the Permanent Representative of Qatar
on behalf of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility
to Protect (see A/72/PV.99)

====================

Sovereignty as responsibility is the philosophical
bedrock of the doctrine of the responsibility to
protect. It is crucial to ensure that this ideology,
based on the understanding that with sovereignty
comes responsibility, remains in view whenever we

discuss the responsibility to protect. Undeniably, in the
experience of Rwanda, we now understand, looking
back, that when a State is responsible for egregious
violations of human rights, that should not prevent
other actors from intervening. This is the essence of the
pillars of the responsibility to protect. It is significant
that we are having this meeting during a year in which
we are celebrating the seventieth anniversaries of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide. It is important that Member States
that have yet to become party to the Convention do so
as an essential step towards accepting the notion that
with sovereignty comes responsibility

====================

Rwanda believes that as the Secretary-General
mentioned in his report, early warning and early action
should be an integral part of national, regional and
international mechanisms to avoid atrocity crimes

====================

This is crucial to enabling States and other relevant
actors to respond rapidly and seek solutions before
situations escalate. In that regard, the Human Rights
Council’s Universal Periodic Review is an important,
well-placed tool for Member States to support atrocitycrimes prevention efforts. Rwanda has accepted and
will endeavour to fully implement 50 Universal Periodic
Review recommendations agreed on in 2015 before the
next review cycle

====================

In our subregion, the East African Community has
established the Eastern Africa Standby Force, which is
mandated to enhance peace and security in the region

====================

It is one of five regional multidimensional forces of the
African Standby Force, consisting of military, police
and civilian components. The African Standby Force
is in the process of implementing its early-warning
system, which will be part of the mechanisms to provide
capability for rapid preventive deployment, peace
support and enforcement operations. Furthermore, the
African Union has taken positive steps to establish the
Continental Early Warning System, which will play
a key role in the African Union Peace and Security
Council’s mission to prevent, manage and resolve
conflicts by anticipating and reporting on situations
across the continent. These are encouraging steps
for ensuring that national Governments and regional
and international organizations are well equipped to
respond to any occurrences of atrocities in good time

====================

I want to conclude by highlighting three areas
that Rwanda believes should be part of the continuous
discussion of the responsibility to protect. The first

is accountability. Holding those involved in atrocity
crimes accountable is fundamental to standing up
against impunity and preventing the recurrence of
such crimes. While national systems have the primary
responsibility for ensuring accountability, when they
are not able to do so, the international system must act
credibly by ensuring that Member States interact on an
equal footing

====================

My second point concerns peacekeeping. As
a troop- and police-contributing country, Rwanda
believes that peacekeepers can be a catalyst for stability
in countries where they are deployed, helping to create
an atmosphere conducive to strengthening peace. The
Kigali Principles on the Protection of Civilians enhance
peacekeeping missions by placing the protection of
civilians at the heart of peacekeeping missions. We
encourage more members to endorse these principles

====================

My third and final point concerns women, peace
and security. Sexual and gender-based violence is a
constant in conflicts around the world. We believe that
aligning the peace and security pillars more closely
with the development and humanitarian pillars to create
greater coordination and coherence, while ensuring
an inclusive approach with women’s participation at
all levels, will enable a more robust response in the
protection of those at risk of widespread sexual violence.
