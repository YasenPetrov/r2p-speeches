I have the honour to speak on
behalf of the members of the Pacific Islands Forum
represented at the United Nations, namely, Australia,
Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, the Federated States
of Micronesia, Nauru, New Zealand, Palau, Papua

New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu
and Vanuatu

====================

The Forum members would like to thank the
Secretary-General, through his Chef de Cabinet, and the
President of the General Assembly for their statements

====================

We also commend the Secretary-General for his report
(A/73/898) and its focus on the importance of early
warning and early action in response to the risk of
mass atrocities

====================

We agree with the Secretary-General that the
implementation of the principle of the responsibility to
protect (R2P), as set out in paragraphs 138 and 139 of
the 2005 World Summit Outcome document, must be
our collective focus. Our task is not to renegotiate or
reinterpret the commitments our leaders made in 2005; it
is to implement them. We therefore welcome the debate
in the Assembly today. Our hope is that this can be part
of an ongoing dialogue in the Assembly about how we
can better protect populations from mass atrocities,
including by sharing experiences, perspectives and
lessons learned to help improve practice internationally,
regionally and domestically. We also agree with the
Secretary-General that the implementation of R2P and
the prioritization of prevention in the United Nations
system are interlinked and complementary. As his
report highlights, preventive capabilities need to be
cultivated at all levels so that early warning also means
early action

====================

Pacific Island Forum members believe that early
dialogue, partnership and action, in particular at
the regional level, are critical to delivering on our
responsibility to protect. The importance of early
warning and early action was recognized and enshrined
by Forum members in the Biketawa Declaration, which
was agreed in Kiribati at the beginning of this century

====================

That important document recognizes the vulnerability
of all Forum members to civil unrest and other threats
to our population’s security. The Declaration articulates
a common commitment to resolving conflicts through
regional cooperation. It has served as the springboard
for a number of regional assistance missions, including
a highly successful mission — the Regional Assistance
Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) — that
commenced in 2003 and concluded last year

====================

RAMSI was a partnership between the people and
the Government of Solomon Islands and 15 contributing
countries from the Pacific region. The mission’s
mandate was to help lay the foundations for long-term

stability and prosperity in Solomon Islands, including
by restoring civil order, rebuilding the machinery
of Government and helping rebuild its economy. The
consent of, and partnership with, Solomon Islands
was a prerequisite for the mission and an essential
element of its success. RAMSI’s regional identity
was its core underlying strength. Every Pacific Island
Forum country participated in RAMSI, and the mission
benefited from the diverse cultures and experience
of contributing members. Since 2003, thousands of
police, military and civilian personnel from across the
region served with RAMSI, walking side by side with
Solomon Islanders

====================

Another critical reason for RAMSI’s success is
that assistance was requested and provided in the early
stages of unrest, lawlessness and violence. The warning
signs were present and action was taken. This is an
example of pillar II of R2P in action

====================

Pacific Islands Forum leaders have committed
to negotiating an updated Biketawa plus declaration
to guide regional responses to emerging security
challenges. At the heart of that commitment is a
recognition that no one country alone can meet the
security challenges we face.
