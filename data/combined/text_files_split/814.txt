(spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I should like to thank the President for her wise
stewardship in convening this meeting. My delegation
takes note of the report of the Secretary-General
(A/73/898) entitled “The responsibility to protect:
lessons learned for prevention”

====================

Contemporary history has taught us harsh lessons
about the humanitarian tragedies that might have been
the result of hate messaging, racism and fascism leading
to dehumanizing the other, discrimination against the
other, violations of the rights of the other and even
attacks on the right to life. Historically, such practices
have always led to events of genocide, war crimes,
crimes against humanity and massacres of all forms in
all kinds of contexts — religious, ethnic or racial

====================

In that regard, Egypt renews its support for the
content of the outcome document of the 2005 World
Summit whereby every State commits to protect its
population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity. We believe that this

is appropriate in order to address grave international
atrocities that originate from hatred within States and
then worsen and evolve to turn into real crimes at a
time when the international community and the United
Nations have not truly taken up their responsibility
under the Charter of the United Nations

====================

My delegation believes that the ideal way to deal
with this thorny issue is to focus efforts on closing
the real gaps that have been revealed by historical
tragedies. At the same time, we must not waste efforts
by trying to develop the concept of the responsibility to
protect (R2P) in a way that runs counter to the current
international consensus. Doing so could threaten the
sovereignty of States and the principles of international
law, in particular the sovereign equality of States and
the prohibition of interference in internal affairs. We
believe that such an expansionist approach is a source
of concern. It undermines international consensus on
the very basis of the concept. It also leads to unfocused
efforts and to politicizing the issue while slowing down
United Nations involvement in dealing with these
atrocities. That in turn can only lead to more thousands
of victims, as history has well taught us

====================

In that regard, we once again stress the fact that the
R2P concept is quite clear in the Charter of the United
Nations and the mechanisms of this international
organization. There is therefore no need to reinvent the
wheel, so to speak, or to expand the interpretation of
the concept. All we need is national political will on
the part of States and the collective will of the entire
international community and the United Nations, as
set out in the 2005 World Summit outcome document

This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches
delivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only

====================

They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member
of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506
(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official
Document System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org)

====================

The fundamental responsibility to protect populations
against atrocities falls on Member States. National and
international efforts to prevent atrocities must focus
on strengthening national capabilities to prevent such
crimes, including by supporting national jurisdictions
in cases of conflict and in post-conflict situations. We
must respect the hierarchy of implementing the three
main pillars pertaining to R2P, where collective work is
the last resort, in line with the United Nations Charter

====================

We would like to question those States that included
this item on the agenda of the General Assembly at its
seventy-second session about its continued inclusion
on the agenda of the current session despite the
understanding at the time that the item would not be
inscribed on the agendas of future sessions. At the
previous session, my delegation, supported by many
others, stressed the need for the item not to be included
on the agenda of the current session until agreement
was reached on a clear and agreed understanding of the
R2P concept

====================

While we welcome the continuation of informal
consultations in that regard, we believe that the
continued inclusion of this item on the agenda, against
the prevailing understanding and in the absence of other
developments, would only weaken the international
consensus. Furthermore, it would lead to a lack of
focus on the real obstacles in dealing with those
atrocities and their causes, whether at the national or
international level

====================

I would like to mention the escalating xenophobia,
hate speech against immigrants and, in particular,
Islamophobia that in some countries have led to a
number of terrorist acts, targeting particular groups of
civilians whose only crime was to be the other. In a
way, that is in line with all forms of ethnic cleansing

====================

We appeal to all States to take appropriate measures
to prevent the perpetration of such atrocities in future

====================

Experience teaches us that, through proper
preparation and a genuine desire to achieve real
consensus, we can enhance the United Nations system
to defend citizens of all groups. Perhaps one of the most
important examples in that regard is Security Council
resolution 2286 (2016), on the protection of health-care
workers and health facilities in armed conflict, which
Egypt, joined by a number of States, drafted during
Egypt’s presidency of the Council in 2016. We believe
that this is the best way to deal with the R2P issue.
