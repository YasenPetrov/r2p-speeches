Statement delivered by Iraq â€“ Informal Interactive Dialogue on R2P, 6 September 2016
[UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTION FROM WEBCAST]

Thank you Sir,

Given that we assume a collective responsibility to protect, Iraq has undertaken a number of initiatives

====================

As for specific initiatives, we signed a joint statement with United Nations representatives for the
prevention of sexual exploitation, which was done in 2016. This was a first step, an initial measure towards
our cooperation with the United Nations to combat sexual exploitation and violence. With this, in the
midst of the heinous crimes perpetrated by Daesh, we sought to tackle numerous challenges in Iraq,
particularly those pertaining to accountability

====================


There was a need to work assiduously to enforce our legislative texts to combat these crimes in my
country. We attempted to document these crimes, to conserve the proof and we sought to ensure that
our judicial authorities have full means to deliver assistance to the victims, particularly children born of
rape perpetrated against Iraqi women. On the basis of this agreement with the United Nations, numerous
experts visited Iraq, and this occurred twice, this with the aim of implementing the joint statement with
the Iraqi National Government

====================


Another measure was taken along the same lines. Iraq consented to having the Security Council adopt the
necessary measures to ensure accountability for Daesh, as regards to crimes against humanity in
particular. A message was addressed to the Secretary General dating 9 August 2017. Iraq worked hand in
hand with its partner within the Security Council, particularly the United Kingdom, to drop a draft
resolution that condemn the crimes of Daesh and which would set up an International Mechanism to
enable us to collect evidence, to document these crimes, and to prosecute the Daesh criminals

====================


Lastly, Iraq would like to thank all of our international partners, those our assisted us and extended their
full support effectively to combat and eradicate these terrorists groups, which constitute the greatest
threat to the international community. The world today is aware of the fact that our collective interests

can only be fulfilled if we fully cooperate to eradicate and prosecute these extremist groups, to protect
our people and create a safe and secure environment for future generations

====================


I thank you

====================
