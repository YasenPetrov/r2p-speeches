This debate is
an opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for the
principles of our responsibility to protect (R2P), as
endorsed at the 2005 World Summit. Yet, despite this
historic commitment, it is clear as we look across the

world that we are failing in our responsibility. The
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees reports that armed conflict and persecution
have led to 70.8 million people being forcibly displaced

====================

Some States Members of the United Nations not only
fail to protect their people, they willingly harm them

====================

Our adherence to R2P has therefore never been more
important. We must continue to assert that States should
protect, not harm, their people. We should anticipate
and defuse conflicts before they begin. And, where
atrocities occur, we should investigate and hold those
responsible accountable. Unlike some, we strongly
support the inclusion of this item on the formal agenda
of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session

====================

We also welcome the Secretary-General’s reports
and the valuable work being done by Special Adviser
Adama Dieng and, now, Karen Smith

====================

Let us remind ourselves what our common
undertakings are. Under pillar I, States must uphold
their obligations under international human rights law,
humanitarian law and refugee law. But there are too
many examples of States that fail to do so because they
are either unable, but more often unwilling, to meet
their responsibilities. Some of those States spoke in
the Hall this morning (see A/73/PV.93). Tellingly, they
dispute the concept of the responsibility to protect

====================

They do so because its existence is a daily repudiation
of their abuses against their own peoples

====================

In Venezuela, economic devastation, starvation and
malnutrition have resulted in the flight of over 3 million
Venezuelans to neighbouring countries — the largest
migration in Latin American history. In Myanmar, a
culture of military impunity left the civilian Government
unable to prevent the mass exodus of 700,000 Rohingya
refugees who have fled to Bangladesh since 2017,
primarily owing to the actions of the Myanmar military

====================

There are a further 244,000 internally displaced
persons within Myanmar. The atrocities against the
Rohingya and other ethnic minorities constitute ethnic
cleansing on an industrial scale and may constitute
genocide. And in Syria, whose representative we heard
from at length this morning (see A/73/PV.93), the
horrifying reports of attacks on schools, hospitals and
first responders and the use of barrel bombs in Idlib are
chilling examples of the devastating effects on civilians
when a State not only fails to uphold its responsibility
to protect, but actively breaches its obligations to do
so. Russia and the Al-Assad regime must cease those
attacks against the Syrian people and respect their

obligations under international human rights law. But
we must all — here — redouble our efforts to help those
people whose own Governments have abandoned them
or actively persecute them

====================

We should also do more, as the Secretary-General’s
reform agenda urges us, to focus on the preventative
capabilities within the responsibility to protect, pillar
II. We know that human rights violations and abuses,
if left unchecked, can be both an indicator of, and a
first step towards, mass atrocities. We welcome the
Secretary-General’s assessment that there needs to be
a more systematic and structured approach across the
United Nations system to information gathering, the
assessment of atrocity risks and collective analysis, so
that Member States can receive early recommendations
for action and prevention. We agree with the SecretaryGeneral that there should be greater use of the Human
Rights Council and the Universal Periodic Review
process to highlight human rights violations and abuses
and to help States respond to them. The Office on
Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect
continues to play an essential role in mainstreaming
R2P within the United Nations and on an international
level. We welcome the appointment of Ms. Karen
Smith as the new R2P Special Adviser and support her
work in partnership with the Special Adviser on the
Prevention of Genocide in bringing potential risks of
atrocity crimes to the attention of the Security Council

====================

Mediation also has a key role. Active preventive
diplomacy and mediation can help prevent atrocities
and reduce tensions and conflict. The United Kingdom
has been a strong supporter of the strengthened United
Nations mediation capacity. The Secretary-General
recently reported that peacebuilding dividends in
respect to Mali, Madagascar, Ethiopia, Eritrea and
South Sudan were all clearly visible from this work

====================

We encourage States to be alert to the early signs of
conflict, engage with communities and civil society
and make use of the Secretary-General’s good offices
and the Mediation Support Unit

====================

These peacebuilding processes and efforts to
prevent conflict also need to be inclusive and diverse

====================

We know that women continue to build peace when
formal processes fail. They lobby for peace processes
to begin when parties refuse to talk, and implement
peace agreements long after international donors have
left. We want to see the United Nations, through support
from the international community, increase the number
of female special envoys nominated by the Secretary-

General, and increase both the number of women
nominated for the Standby Team of Senior Mediation
Advisers and the number of female candidates selected

====================

Finally, on the third pillar, accountability and
ending impunity are vital for deterring the recurrence of
atrocity crimes. States have the primary responsibility
to investigate and prosecute crimes committed within
their jurisdictions. While international courts and
hybrid tribunals can play an important role where
States are genuinely unwilling or unable to do so, the
United Nations should draw on diverse mechanisms
to identify risks and take early action to prevent
countries from falling into greater crisis. We will
continue to shine a light on appalling violations of
international humanitarian law and human rights law
in situations such as Syria and Myanmar. There should
be no impunity for those who perpetrate such crimes
and atrocities

====================

There were a handful of suggestions in the Hall this
morning that the responsibility to protect is somehow
discredited. However, those voices are an insignificant
minority when set against the voices of support we have
heard today. But our words of support need to result
in real action. Yesterday, in this Hall, we recommitted
ourselves to the Charter of the United Nations — we the
peoples. But what good is that if we do not recommit
ourselves to the responsibility to protect those peoples?
We call on all Member States to do all in their power
to prevent and end atrocities against the peoples and to
prosecute those responsible for them. We owe this to
those who cannot protect themselves.
