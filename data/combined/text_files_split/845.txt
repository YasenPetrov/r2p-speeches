Australia is a member
of the cross-regional Global Alliance for Torture-free
Trade and strongly supported resolution 73/304

====================

Trade in goods that can be used only for torture
and other cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment or
punishment has been a long-standing concern at the
United Nations. Over 30 years ago, the first Special
Rapporteur on torture, appointed by the Commission on
Human Rights, addressed the issue in an early report

====================

Several resolutions have called for action in this field,
most recently resolution 72/163, on torture and other
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,
which was adopted without a vote

====================

Regional organizations, such as the African
Union Commission and the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, have recognized the
seriousness of the torture trade and recommended
action. One hundred and sixty-six States have ratified
the Convention against Torture, and have thereby
pledged to take effective legislative, administrative,
judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in
any territory under their jurisdiction. Taking steps to
address the trade in torture goods is a critical way by
which such prevention can be assured

====================

The approach proposed in resolution 73/304 is
intended first and foremost to solicit the views of
all Member States as to how common international
standards might be formulated in future. The views of
all Member States will form the basis for the report of
the Secretary-General, which will then be considered
by a group of governmental experts chosen on the basis
of equitable geographical distribution. We do not assert,
and neither does the resolution, that the imposition of
the death penalty per se amounts to torture or cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Neither
do we assert, and nor does the resolution, that the death
penalty is prohibited per se under international law

====================

The resolution requests that the group of
governmental experts consider, among other things,
the scope of goods to be covered by any common
international standards. That is because certain goods
that are traded, including portable gas chambers, can
be used in ways that inflict undue suffering.
