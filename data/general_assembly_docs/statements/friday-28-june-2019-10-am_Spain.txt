terrorism and stressed the ethical and moral need to

The resolution just adopted calls upon Member
States to develop comprehensive assistance plans for
the victims of terrorism that address their immediate
and short- and long-term needs. Resolution 73/305

recognition they deserve. We intend to continue
working to change that situation. With the adoption
of resolution 73/305, on which we again congratulate
Afghanistan, we are optimistic and hopeful that we are
finally moving in the right direction.
