(spoke in Arabic): My
delegation would like to explain its vote on draft
resolution A/73/L.94. We will vote against the draft
resolution for the following reasons.
First, the sponsors of the draft resolution did not
take into account the comments and points of views
made by other parties that have concerns or doubts
about the text of the draft resolution.
Secondly, my countryâ€™s delegation fully rejects
the linkage between, on the one hand, the crime of
torture, which has been rejected under all international,
regional and national laws, and, on the other,
punishments, including capital punishment, that are
carried out in accordance with legislative mechanisms
and careful judgments, as well as sovereign laws that
must be respected at all levels. In principle, we reject
the equation of the crime of torture and harsh practices
with national judgments.
Thirdly, the draft resolution is general in nature
and lacks clarity. It does not include any reference to
the tools to be prohibited. The crime of torture can be
carried out with different tools, including very simple
ones. If those tools were listed in the draft resolution,
my delegation would have supported it. My country is
committed to the Convention against Torture and Other
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,
which was ratified by the Yemeni Republic in 1991.
